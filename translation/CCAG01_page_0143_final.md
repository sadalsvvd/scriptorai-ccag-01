The Moon, possessing the zone nearest to the earth, moves in a windy and moist air, receiving the exhalation from all things and partaking of both the exhalations of the winds and of the earth; therefore, by its nature, it is established as both purifying and temperate. It holds the place of queen of the entire cosmos, being manifold in its relation to earthly and generable things because of the swiftness of its motion, producing rapid effects of exhalations toward the earth due to its proximity; especially whenever it approaches for every generation, both after the full moon and after the conjunction with the Sun, during both waxing and waning; for from conjunction up to full moon it becomes more active toward generable things upon the earth due to the increase of light, but from full moon to conjunction it becomes more inert because of the decrease of light. It is likewise established as the cause of both inundations and recessions occurring in the ocean.

F. 68. On Conjunctions and Full Moons; [On Inceptions].

Conjunctions and full moons should not be observed by malefics; the full moon should not fall in an eclipsing position; conjunctions and full moons should not be diametrically opposed nor squared by malefics, for they bring harm and abasement to inceptions; in general, the circumstance is grievous. Let the lords of conjunctions and full moons not be afflicted, for they are sent out from their land and homeland; moreover, they also bring poverty. And when malefics observe, they also take away violently; but when the lords are well disposed, they bring advancement and distinction. When the lords of conjunctions and full moons fall in adverse places, they cause those who borrow or lend to lose their possessions, especially when in fixed signs in one’s homeland (for borrowings from relatives), and in tropical signs (for borrowings from strangers). Let the lords of the Ascendant and the Moon not be diametrically opposed to each other; for they cause one to end his days away from his homeland, and if malefics also observe, to die a violent death.

Scholion to line 6: That the lords of conjunctions and full moons, when afflicted, produce exile or poverty; and when aspected by malefics, they also take away violently.

The same passage is found excerpted in codex 7, folio 152v, where it is perhaps more correctly titled: On Inceptions at Conjunctions and Full Moons, and supplemented by περὶ καταρχῶν in the margin, 16th century.
