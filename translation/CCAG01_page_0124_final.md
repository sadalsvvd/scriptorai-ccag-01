EXCERPTS FROM CODEX 12 (Laur. 28, 34)

Folio 16. On Crisis Points; Epitome of Pancharius¹.

<In Aries> The Moon, when it is present with Mars or the Sun, or is in square or opposition to them, and with Saturn in the same configuration, is above all additive to the numbers or to the light, and—without consideration of the benefic (planet)—eliminates up until the seventh.^1🤖 The Moon in aspect to Saturn is subtractive with respect to the light, and more so to the numbers, and about the ninetieth degree signifies grave <illnesses>; but if Hermes (Mercury) alone is configured with Saturn in relation to the Moon, it eliminates infallibly. The Sun and Hermes, in the given configuration, are rather to be understood as defenders for you; however, they are also benefics: if they are superimposed, one comes to extreme danger, but having passed beyond the opposition, one is saved. The Moon with Hermes and the Sun is additive to the numbers or even to the light, and produces hazardous and acute conditions up to the opposition; but if Hermes is configured, one who is endangered is saved. The Moon with Hermes, and both, and even with only one of the benefics, produces shifting diseases and transitions to others in an irregular manner, but always saves infallibly.

<In Taurus> The Moon with Saturn, especially with respect to the numbers and the light, is subtractive—provided that the benefics are not observing—and eliminates infallibly up to the opposition. When Mars or also the Sun have the same configuration, at the first square it eliminates, but if the benefics are observ—

¹ [Kroll has informed us (Philologus N. F. XI, 1898, p. 123) that Pancharius Ptolemy wrote a commentary as far as this point, based on Book II, chapter 11 of Hephaestion, which is still unpublished. He also added that in codex Marcianus 336, folio 256r, there is found an excerpt of Pancharius on bloodletting and purgations (on which subject cf. Kühn, Galeni opera, vol. XIX, p. 519). The material transmitted under his name in the Laurentian codex has parallels in Book III of Hermes Trismegistus to Ammonius, On Heating Substances (Περὶ θερμαινόντων, Ideler, Physici minores, I, p. 391 ff.), from which the text of the Florentine book can sometimes be emended. I believe both works to have been abridged from a larger book, apparently composed in verse (see p. 119, v. 12, p. 121, v. 32). — F. C.]

^1🤖 "Additive to the numbers or to the light"—here, "numbers" (τοῖς ἀριθμοῖς) and "light" (τῷ φωτί) are technical terms in Hellenistic astrology, possibly referring to numerical indications (timings, degree counts) or to the presence/strength of light (luminescence, possibly health/vitality). Also, "additive" and "subtractive" (προσθετικὴ, ἀφαιρετικὴ) may relate to the increase or decrease in potency, effect, or vitality during planetary aspects.
