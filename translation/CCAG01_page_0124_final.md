Folio 16. On Crisis: A Synopsis by Pancharius¹.

<In Aries>: The Moon, being present with Mars or the Sun, or forming a square or opposition to them, while Saturn holds the same configuration, is particularly additive to numbers or to light; but, unless regarded as a benefic, it destroys up to the seventh [day]. The Moon with Saturn, being more subtractive to light and to numbers, indicates severe diseases around the ninetieth degree; but if Mercury is only configured with Saturn in relation to the Moon, it invariably destroys. The Sun and Mercury, in relation to this configuration, should be understood as supporters; however, they are also benefic, and if they intervene, the outcome will reach the height of danger, but after passing beyond the opposition, there will be safety. The Moon with Mercury and the Sun is additive to the numbers or also to the light, but it causes dangerous and acute sufferings up to the opposition; but if Mercury is configured, one will be saved after having been in danger. The Moon with Mercury, and with both, and even with only one of the benefics, causes irregular and shifting diseases, but nonetheless saves unfailingly.

<In Taurus>: The Moon with Saturn, being most subtractive to numbers and to light, if benefics do not watch over, invariably destroys up to the opposition. But if Mars or even the Sun hold the same configuration, it destroys at the first square, but if the benefics are observ—

¹ [Kroll has informed us (Philologus N. F. XI, 1898, p. 123) that Ptolemaeus wrote a commentary on Pancharius from Book II, ch. 11 of Hephaestion up to this point, as yet unpublished. He also added that in codex Marcianus 336, folio 256r, a fragment by Pancharius concerning phlebotomy and purgations is found (on which subject see Kühn, Galeni opera, vol. XIX, p. 519). Similar material is provided by Book III of Hermes Trismegistus to Ammon, On Things Producing Heat (περὶ θερμαινόντων) (Ideler, Physici minores, I, p. 391ff.), from which the text of the Florentine book can sometimes be corrected. Both works, I believe, were abridged from a larger book seemingly composed in verse (p. 119, l. 12; p. 121, l. 32). — F. C.]
