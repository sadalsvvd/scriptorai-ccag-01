When the Moon is unaspected and is with Jupiter, it makes people unsuccessful, humble, and of low status in life; when the Moon is unaspected and is with Mars, it makes them moderate, timid, obscure, and estranged from their parents; when the Moon is unaspected and is with Venus, it causes lack of grace and difficulty attaining success in both marriage and romantic or sexual unions; when the Moon is unaspected and is with Hermes (Mercury), it brings about greater ineffectiveness and folly.^1🤖 All these configurations, I say, pertain to the co-ascensional, equally rising, and equally powerful signs of the zodiac.^2🤖

53. The Results of the Attendants of the Sun.

When Saturn is found attending, he produces moderation, pride, good fortune from the father, and great wealth. Jupiter produces justice, hospitality, ostentation, brilliance, command, wealth, and success. Mars produces manliness, hot-temperedness, boldness, recklessness, violence, arrogance, and contempt among those encountered.^3🤖 Venus produces fame, charm, pleasantness, shamelessness, suitability for marriage, and success. Hermes (Mercury) provides natural talent, reasoning, and cleverness.

It should be understood that if the attending planets deviate while the luminaries (Sun or Moon) are at their centers (angular positions), they nonetheless bring about kingship or tyranny for those so born; but if the luminaries are attended yet are themselves deviating, such people will not become kings or tyrants, but rather friends of such persons. The same should be understood with respect to attendants by preference.^4🤖

On the Diverse Appellations Applied to the Sections of the Zodiac According to Their Proper Activities and Forms.

Deeming the various names of the zodiacal forms, as uniquely distinguished by the ancients, to be of use, we have decided to append a summary of those introduced here and to include this in the edition, so that from all these designations one might appropriately deduce the natural rationale; in summary, there are, it is said, fifty-two differences. That is, some are commanding, others secondary, others subordinate, others terrestrial, others aquatic, and so forth.^5🤖

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Unaspected" translates the technical term for the Moon not forming a traditional aspect with another planet; "is with" is used in the astrological sense of presence or conjunction.
^2🤖 The phrase "co-ascensional, equally rising, and equally powerful signs of the zodiac" preserves technical language referring to specific relationships between zodiacal signs in Greek astrology.
^3🤖 "Among those encountered" translates a phrase that could be rendered as "among those present" or "with respect to those one meets;" the Greek could also support an interpretation focused on those who transgress, but the general sense is retained here.
^4🤖 The technical phrase "when the luminaries are at their centers (angular positions)" means when the Sun or Moon are in angular houses (Ascendant, Midheaven, etc.). "Attendants by preference" refers to planets that act as attendants by election rather than strict configuration.
^5🤖 The final passage introduces a taxonomy of zodiacal signs by qualities, continued beyond this extract.
