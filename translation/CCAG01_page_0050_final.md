LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek phrase refers to using the ascendant as representative of the husband in determining whether the wife will return, with a strong implication of reconciliation.  
^2🤖 “Opponent <sic>” preserves an editorial note signaling the manuscript’s possibly unusual reading. If the context is legal, “litigant” could be appropriate; otherwise, “opponent” is more general.  
^3🤖 “Double-bodied sign” (Gemini, Sagittarius, Pisces, Virgo) is standard in astrology; a benefic planet present indicates favorability.  
^4🤖 The phrase allows alternate renderings such as “whether he will find him or not.”  
^5🤖 “Lord of the ascendant” refers to the planetary ruler; the phrase means that if this planet is returning, so is the traveler.  
^6🤖 “Otherwise” signals a miscellaneous or alternative procedure; “angle” is a technical term for the astrological angles (ascendant, descendant, MC, IC).  
^7🤖 “Observe the indication of the ascendant—no fortune results” is literal; alternate renderings are possible (“no one’s fortune,” etc.).  
^8🤖 “Of the lesser” is a traditional way to refer to the underdog or the less prominent participant.  
^9🤖 Context may suggest watching the Moon’s position or phase for determining the return of envoys.  
^10🤖 “Undergo it” is more idiomatic than “perform it” or “go through with it” in the context of slavery.  
^11🤖 The original means to examine the ascendant for an indication of whether the act (killing) will occur.  
^12🤖 “See Hermes” likely refers to Hermes Trismegistus, often cited in astrological literature.  
^13🤖 “Of blood” could refer to suspicion of criminal conduct or the suspect’s involvement in violence.  
^14🤖 “Separations and conjunctions” translates Greek technical terms (ἀπορροιαί, συναφές) for astrological aspects, especially in nativities (birth charts).  
^15🤖 “Temperament of the signs” could refer to their qualities (hot, cold, dry, moist) or possibly to color, due to manuscript variation; see critical apparatus for discussion.
