^1🤖 The phrase “Ἔτους ζμισ᾽” is Greek numeration. ζμισ᾽ should be read as the numeral 2479 (ζ = 7, μ = 40, ι = 10, σ = 200, ʹ = 1000; thus, (1000 + 700 + 40 + 10 + 200 + 9) = 2479), but the precise year may vary depending on manuscript context. "Spider-web" (ἀράχνη) refers to the web or grid pattern marking the fixed stars on the astrolabe.
