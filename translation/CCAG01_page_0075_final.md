¹ For Teucer of Babylon, see above, at 71v. — The same excerpt, On the Paranatellonta, is found in codex Paris 2503, f. 119v; see Porphyry, Introduction to Ptolemy, f. 200, ed. 1559, and Psellus, On Marvelous Readings, p. 147, Westermann.
² "Fishes" refers to the sign Pisces—a technical note, not "Fishermen."
³ The phrase “agreement of executors (or witnesses of property) and heirs” renders “συμφωνίαν πραγματωμαρτύρων κληρονόμων δηλοῖ”; “πραγματωμαρτύρων” might also be translated “witnesses of property” depending on context, but “executors” is common in legal-astrological texts.
⁴ “Hemerodromion” is retained as a technical term for a day-by-day astrological calendar or diary.
⁵ “Forms and phases” translates terms like “μορφαί” and “φάσεις,” both of which can refer to lunar apparitions and phases.
⁶ “Thema” is the technical astrological term for the horoscope or chart, kept here for scholarly precision.
⁷ “Oualēs” is a transliteration; alternate spellings may appear in English literature.
⁸ “Sirius (the Dog-Star)” clarifies the technical/astronomical reference.
⁹ “Domiciles” is the technical term for planetary “houses,” not to be confused with the 12 astrological “houses.”

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Paranatellonta” (παρανατέλλοντα): Technical term for stars or constellations rising simultaneously with each zodiac sign; best retained in transliteration for scholarly clarity, explained at first use.

^2🤖 “Fishes” should be interpreted as Pisces, not “Fishermen,” unless the original Greek says ἁλιεῖς.

^3🤖 The phrase “agreement of executors (or witnesses of property) and heirs” captures το σύμφωνον πραγματωμαρτύρων κληρονόμων, a technical legal-astrological term. “Executors” is the more traditional reading; however, a literal “witnesses of property” is also possible depending on context.

^4🤖 “Hemerodromion” (ἡμεροδρόμιον) is sometimes translated as “Day-Book” or “Almanac,” but the technical Greek is standard in specialist literature.

^5🤖 “Forms and phases” includes both standard words for lunar aspects in Greek astrology.

^6🤖 “Thema” is the standard technical term for a horoscope/nativity.

^7🤖 “Oualēs” appears thus in the tradition; variant spellings occur.

^8🤖 Both “Sirius” and “Dog-Star” designate the same star; spelling out both aids English readers.

^9🤖 “Domiciles” is standard for the planetary signs/rulerships, not ordinary houses.
