LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The word "affective" translates "ἐμπαθῶν," which can also mean "passionate" or "subject to passions." "Limbs of the enigmatic signs" reflects "μελῶν τῶν αἰνιγματωδῶν ζῳδίων." The parenthesis notes that other locations (τόποι) connected with Venus are also considered.

^2🤖 "Wine-producing degrees" (οἰνοποιῶν μοιρῶν) refers to astrological degrees associated with wine or the production of wine. The phrase in parentheses is fragmentary; I render "Many indeed—but harmful" to mirror the Greek syntax.

^3🤖 "Joinings and separations" translates "συναφῶν καὶ ἀπορροιῶν," common technical terms for lunar aspects in astrology. "Void-of-course" captures "κενοδρομοῦσα," and the sentence is left open to reflect the Greek fragmentary style.

^4🤖 "Boundaries" for "ὅρια" is standard astrological terminology. "Things being lost" (ἀπολλόμενα) might also be interpreted as "lost items" or "what is perishing."
