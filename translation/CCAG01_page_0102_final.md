Just as is the star, so too is the one who receives [the thing].^1ðŸ¤– If a star is in its own house at the lower midheaven, it is raised up from some place toward something domestic; but if it is in an alien house at the opposition, say that it has been carried away to a foreign neighbor. And if the star is in its own house and another is with it, say there will be strife and rivalry over them, between the one who lost the item, the one possessing it, and the one who stole it. If the Sun or the Moon casts its rays upon these stars, the matter will be reported. If, at the midheaven, the stars are in their own domicile, say the owner of the lost item has thrown it away; if in another's house, that he has deposited it with another. One must observe the Moon not only in cases of theft but with respect to every matter; for as she increases in light and in number, say the lost item is either new or valuable; but if she is waning in light and in number, it is neither valuable nor much missed, nor is it new.

When the Sun and Moon regard the Ascendant, they indicate that the thief is from the household; but if one of the two luminaries regards the Ascendant and the other does not, the entry is from outside; but if neither the Sun nor Moon regards the Ascendant, the thief is an outsider. The stars indicate the forms and appearances of the thieves: the first is the one in the west; if none is found there, look to the one in the ninth; if not, the one in the twelfth. Seek to whom the Moon is applying, and by that star and its phase you will find the thief similar in nature and appearance; but if even this does not correspond, observe which of the stars, within seven days before the loss, moved from one sign to another, and by its nature, phase, and appearance, declare the thief.

If the star or place indicating the thief is testified by a benefic, it signifies a free person; but if by a malefic, a slave or someone pretending to be a slave. If Venus occupies the place indicating the thief, it shows a female thief. You must also compare the phases and the ages; for the first eastern rising indicates youths, the setting under the rays indicates old age; the first station and the acronychal rising those in midlife; the second station and the occultation, those after midlife. Reckon everything according to the phasesâ€”you will discover the dispositions and ages exactly. For instance, if Saturn happens to be in the place of the thief, east of the heliacal rising, it means neither children nor old people, but those in midlife; Mercury as evening and oriental, young men or boys; Venus as evening and oriental, girls; Mercury under the Sunâ€™s setting, mature men; Venus under the Sunâ€™s setting, mature women; those both eastern and western indicate youths; but under the setting...

1ðŸ¤– The original Greek phrase expresses a direct parallel: "Just as the star, so too the recipient we will describe." This underscores a correspondence between the qualities or condition of the relevant star and the person concerned. Alternate renderings might include: "As is the star, so is the one who receives it."
