And whichever the star, such also will we say is the one receiving it. If the star is in its own house, in the supporting angle of the midheaven it will appear, having been raised from some place to its own; but if in another's domicile, in opposition, say that it has been carried off to a foreign neighbor. But if the star is in its own house and another is together with it, say that there will be strife and rivalry between them—between the loser, the possessor, and the thief. If the Sun or the Moon casts its rays upon these stars, the matter will be revealed. And if, in the midheaven sign, the stars are in their own house, say that the master of the lost thing has thrown it away; if in another’s, that he has deposited it with another. The Moon must be observed not only in cases of thefts but also with respect to every matter; for when it increases in light and in number, say that the lost thing is new or of great value; but if it is waning in light and in number, it is not valuable, worn out, not new. 

The Sun and the Moon, if they look upon the ascendant, indicate that the thief is from the house; but if one of the two luminaries looks at the ascendant but the other does not, there is ingress from outside; but if neither the Sun nor the Moon observes the ascendant, the thief is a stranger. The stars indicate the forms and appearances of the thieves: the first is the one in the west; but if none is present there, the one in the ninth; if not, the one in the twelfth. Seek with whom the Moon makes its application, and according to that planet and her aspect, you will find the thief similar; but if not even this is in agreement, see which of the stars, within seven days before the loss, changed from one sign into another, and according to its nature, aspect, and appearance, identify the thief.

As for the star or place indicating the thief, if a benefic testifies, it signifies a free person; but if a malefic, a slave or a person of servile demeanor. If Venus occupies the place of the thief, it signifies that a female is the thief. You must also compare the aspects and the ages: for the oriental rising signifies children, the setting signifies old age; the first station and the acronychal, those of middle age; the second station and concealment, those after middle age. Therefore, count everything together according to the aspects; you will accurately find the temperaments and the ages. For example: if Saturn happens to be in the place of the thief, orientally rising, it indicates neither a child nor an old man, but one of middle age; Mercury vespertine and oriental, youths or children; Venus vespertine and oriental, maidens; Mercury under the setting of the Sun, mature men; Venus under the setting of the Sun, mature women. Those with oriental and occidental positions signify youths; but under concealment...
