Hermes; feminine are the Moon and Aphrodite. Yet these stars are sometimes masculinized, sometimes feminized: they are masculinized, indeed, when they happen to be eastern relative to the Sun, that is, when they are found in the zodiacal signs preceding the Sun within about fifteen degrees; and they are feminized when they chance to be western relative to the Sun, found within about fifteen degrees behind the Sun. Moreover, the stars are masculinized when found in masculine signs and are moving northward; but they are feminized when in feminine signs and moving southward. Again, the stars are masculinized when found in the masculine quadrants—that is, from the midheaven to the ascendant, and from the lower midheaven to the descendant—while they are feminized in the feminine quadrants, that is, from the descendant to the lower midheaven, or from the ascendant to the midheaven. And the stars that are masculinized in masculine signs or masculine quadrants contribute to masculine nativities; for they produce individuals who are self-willed, bold, possessing courage within themselves; while in women, they make them unchaste, shameless, daring, rebellious, and, in matters of intercourse, masculinized—that is, tribads.^1🤖 On the other hand, when the stars are feminized, whether by the phases, the signs, or the quadrants, they make men soft, effeminate in spirit, timid, utterly prone to subordination, feminized, and generally impotent or performing women's work; while women they make downcast, modest, bashful, stern, obedient to their husbands, and accepting the regulations pertaining to women. So much, then, concerning those stars that are, in our reckoning, morning or evening; for the western and separating stars are found to be inactive, weaker, and more irregular in practical matters—excepting the so-called "engirdled" stars.^2🤖 "Engirdled" stars are so called when they are accompanying the Sun at an equal distance, either in degrees before or after. Of this phase, none of the ancients made mention, but we, upon experiment, have included it, since even Ptolemy mentioned the phase of conjunction without stating its effect.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term "tribads" (Greek τριβάδες) refers historically to women regarded as taking an active or "masculine" role in sexual relations with other women. The term is left untranslated for historical precision; it does not neatly equate to modern identities.

^2🤖 "Engirdled" (Greek ἔγκαρδιοι) is the established term in technical astrological literature for stars in close conjunction with the Sun, i.e., those accompanying the Sun at an equal distance ahead or behind in degrees. Alternatives such as "heart-bound" or "co-heart" exist but are less common in the scholarly tradition.
