Ibid. 58. Inquiry at the commencement concerning the fear for a ship in Athens.

In the year of Diocletian 160, in the month of Epiphi, on the 22nd, at the first hour of the day,  
the Sun in Cancer at the 21st degree, the Moon in Gemini at the 21st degree, Saturn in Leo at the 17th degree, Hermes (Mercury) in Cancer at the 7th degree. *** Raising Gemini as always, having first sought the Lot of Fortune, I found it in the twelfth, in the cadent sign; and you will find this configuration set out in the seventh chapter of the commencements: that if the Lot of Fortune is found in the twelfth, it signifies that the inquiry concerns fear and danger and their actual occurrence, and loss of goods, and theft, and damage from enemies and from lawsuits, and from a slave, and from a stranger, and from quadrupeds; for the inquiry was found, due to the cadency of the sign, to be concerning a ship, and because of the twelfth place, concerning fear and danger and loss and exile and a slave and quadrupeds. Moreover, also the rulers of the hour and of the Moon, having turned away, signified that the inquiry was concerning strangers. They also said that they had undergone danger and loss and damage, because Mars and Saturn were at the ascendant; and again, because of the presence of Venus and the Moon's conjunction with Jupiter, and after enduring trial, they were ultimately saved. They also said that they brought quadrupeds, on account of the Lot of Fortune, as has been said, and on account of Leo being exalted; and they brought camels. Having also consulted the section of Dorotheus as to what was lost, because the Moon was in Gemini, they said that they were bringing some valuables and all things that pertain to pleasure and festivity; and they brought cortinas, frontalia, and accubitalia. Noticing also that there were the bounds of Mars, they said that they were bringing certain implements made at the anvil and forged with the hammer; and they brought argomoukia (?)—silver weights (?). They also said that since the Moon was in Sagittarius, the ship was coming to Pisces, having considered the diameters and the square of the Moon, so that also the Sun would come into its own house at the ascendant; and when the Moon had come into Sagittarius, they arrived. Therefore, if someone applies the chapters of the ancients, one finds not a few reasonable analogies.        [A. O.]
