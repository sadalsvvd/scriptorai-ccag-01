Ibid. 58. Inquiry at the outset concerning fear for a ship in Athens.

In the year of Diocletian 160 (A.D. 475), in the month of Epiphi, on the 22nd day, at the first hour of the day,  
the Sun at 21° Cancer, the Moon at 21° Gemini, Saturn at 17° Leo, Mercury at 7° Cancer. *** Having ascended Gemini and, after first invariably seeking the Lot of Fortune, I found it in the twelfth, in a cadent sign; and you will find this configuration set forth in the seventh chapter of the Inceptions. For if the Lot of Fortune is found in the twelfth, it denotes that the inquiry^1🤖 involves fear and peril and something substantial (i.e., real danger), as well as deprivation of goods, theft, and damage by enemies, litigation, slaves, foreigners, and quadrupeds^2🤖. For the inquiry was made, because of the position of the sign, about a ship, and, because of the twelfth place, about fear, peril, damage, exile, slaves, and quadrupeds. Now, also, the rulers of the hour and of the Moon, having turned away, indicated that the inquiry concerned foreigners. They also said that they had endured danger and loss and damage, because Mars and Saturn were on the ascendant; and again, because of the presence of Venus and the Moon’s application to Jupiter and encountering a test, after having fallen into peril and being struck with fear, they were in fact saved; and I said they were bringing quadrupeds, because of the Lot of Fortune, as has been said above, and because of the Lion (Leo) being elevated; and, in fact, they brought camels. And when I sought Dorotheus’ chapter about what was being lost, because the Moon was in Gemini, I said they were bringing some precious things and whatever comes for delight and feasting; indeed, they brought curtains, frontalia^3🤖, and accubitalia^3🤖. And, having paid attention also to the boundaries of Aries, I said they were bringing some implements fashioned from anvil and hammer; and they brought orgomoukia^4🤖—silver basteggia^4🤖 (dishes). I also said that, since the Moon was in Sagittarius, the ship would go towards Pisces, observing the diameters (i.e., oppositions) and the square aspect of the Moon, so that the Sun also might come to the ascendant’s own house; and, in fact, when the Moon came into Sagittarius, they arrived. Therefore, if one uses the chapters of the ancients, one finds not a few reasonable points of departure.         [A. O.]

Ibid. 59. Another inquiry at Smyrna concerning fear for a ship; for long had they expected one to have arrived from Alexandria, and it had not yet arrived.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The translation “the inquiry involves fear and peril and something substantial (i.e., real danger)” reflects the Greek meaning, where “καὶ ὄντως ἔχειν” could also be read as “and it truly holds/exists,” i.e., it is a real or present concern. Alternative: “and indeed [danger] is present.”

^2🤖 “Quadrupeds”: The Greek τετραπόδων may refer specifically to pack animals, beasts of burden, or more generally to livestock; I have rendered it broadly as “quadrupeds” in line with astrological usage, but in context it likely means valuable or transported animals.

^3🤖 “Frontalia and accubitalia”: These are uncertain terms; frontalia may refer to ornamental bands or drapery, and accubitalia to cushions for couches (from the Latin accubitalia, dining-couch cloths), often mentioned in inventories of luxury items.

^4🤖 “‘Orgomoukia’, ‘basteggia’”: The Greek words here are difficult and possibly corrupt or transliterated foreign terms for specific luxury or metal objects; the editorial note suggests ‘silver’ as a possible reading for ἀργυρά. I have transliterated these terms, as their precise meaning is unknown.
