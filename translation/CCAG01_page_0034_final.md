LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ðŸ¤– The repetition of "StÃª. (306)" reflects the Greek manuscript divisions; the topics differ, so both are kept.

^2ðŸ¤– The repetition ("The twelfth-part of the Moonâ€”the twelfth-part of the Moon") mirrors the original's terse referential style.

^3ðŸ¤– The term <stars> is supplied editorially where the Greek refers elliptically to diurnal and nocturnal entities; see apparatus for details.
