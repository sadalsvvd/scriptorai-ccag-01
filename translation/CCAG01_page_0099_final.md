APPENDIX

...together, stating: “Enclosure (ἐμπερίσχεσις, emperischēsis) occurs when malefic stars surround a single intermediary with no ray of any other star intervening between them; and this form of enclosure is the most grievous. Enclosure may also occur when, in the degrees before or after the application (συναφή, synaphē—planetary approach or conjunction)^1🤖, another star casts a ray from differing, as previously described, configurations. Such an enclosure is also harsh if effected by destructive stars, but is beneficial when by beneficent ones.

F. 45. 35. On the Dodecatemoria of the Zodiac.

Furthermore, each dodecatemorion (δωδεκατημόριον, dodekatēmorion) is likewise divided into twelve dodecatemoria, assigning two degrees to each. From the first degree of the zodiacal sign up to the degree reached by the star, however many degrees there are, these are taken and divided into portions of two degrees each, assigning each portion to the following signs, beginning from the zodiacal sign which starts at the moment in question. Wherever the final sum of the portions falls, that is said to be the dodecatemorion^2🤖 of the star at that moment. For example, let the Moon be precisely at the 20th degree of Cancer; twenty degrees divided by two gives eight portions, since two and a half times eight makes twenty. Projecting^3🤖 these eight portions, sign by sign, from Cancer itself, we reach Aquarius, and so we say that, at the stated moment of the Moon, its dodecatemorion is in Aquarius.

F. 212. From the Astronomical Introduction of Hephaestion

Of the arrangement of the heavens, such is that of the zodiacal circle, within which the wandering stars carry out their movements, as depicted in the figure to be outlined here. I shall endeavor, as far as I am able, to set out concisely both the nomenclature for the twelve houses pertaining to it, and likewise the configurations of the stars with one another—their distinctions as masculine and feminine, fiery, watery, earthy, or airy, which are equinoctial and which tropical—and all other factors contributing to an understanding of the overall configuration, in order that what the men of old have said concerning world events may become readily comprehensible and clear. And first, we shall discuss the disposition (διάθεμα, diathema—‘figure’), which most people call the “theatron” (θέατρον, theatron—‘theatre’).

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term “application” (συναφή, synaphē) designates the approach or coming together of two planets (or degrees), a standard technical concept in Hellenistic astrology. “Degrees before or after the application” thus refers to those immediately preceding or following the formation of a planetary aspect.

^2🤖 “Dodecatemorion” (δωδεκατημόριον, dodekatēmorion) is the technical term for a twelfth-part, a minor subdivision of the zodiacal degrees used in ancient astrology. The calculation described is a standard procedure for determining its astrological placement.

^3🤖 “Projecting” (προσεκβάλλοντες, prosekvallontes) refers to counting forward sign by sign from the natal sign, a key step in dodecatemorion computation. Alternate renderings might include “setting out from” or “computing from” the initial sign.
