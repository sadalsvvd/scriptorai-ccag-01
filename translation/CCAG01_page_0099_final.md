APPENDIX

…together saying: empērischesis (enclosure) is when malefic stars enclose a single body in the middle, with no other star’s ray coming between them, and this enclosure is the most grievous. Enclosure is also said to occur when, within the seven degrees before or after the conjunction, another star sends its ray from different, as previously described, configurations; this type of enclosure is also grievous when caused by destructive stars, and is beneficent when caused by benefic stars.

They have also divided each of the dodecatemoria into twelve dodecatemoria, assigning two degrees to each; for, from the first degree of the sign up to the degree which the star occupies, as many degrees as there are, taking these and dividing in twos, and assigning each portion to the subsequent signs, starting from the sign itself as it stands at that time—wherever the count of portions ends, they say that sign is the dodecatemorion of the star according to its position. For example, let the Moon be entirely in the twentieth degree of Cancer; the twenty degrees, divided in twos, yield eight portions (for two and a half times eight makes twenty). Advancing these eight from Cancer itself, we arrive at Aquarius, and so we say that for the position described, the dodecatemorion of the Moon is in Aquarius.

F. 212. From the astronomical preface of Hephaestion.

Concerning the celestial disposition, namely of the zodiacal circle in which the planets make their own motions, arranged as depicted in the following diagram, I will attempt, as far as I am able, to set forth briefly the names of the twelve places, and the configurations of the stars to each other, specifying which are masculine and which are feminine, which are fiery, which watery, which earthy, which airy, which are equinoctial and which are tropical, and all the other factors that contribute to the discernment of the whole arrangement, so that the pronouncements of the ancients regarding events in the cosmos may become clear and understandable. And first, we shall discuss the arrangement which many call the “thema.”
