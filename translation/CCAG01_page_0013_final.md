^1🤖 “ψηφοφορία” literally means “voting” or “counting-off,” but in the context of Greek astronomical texts, it refers to a computational or tabular procedure for determining positions, here of the planets (“wandering stars”).
^2🤖 Refers to the line in chiromancy (palmistry) known as the “life-giving line”; the parenthetical phrase reflects a traditional interpretation linking certain palm features with susceptibility to women.
^3 “Argyrus” is a name; “argentarius” (“the silversmith” or “money-changer”) is a possible title or nickname.
^4🤖 “Will refuse to speak freely” attempts to render “τῷ παρρησιάζεσθαι παραιτήσονται,” which carries the sense of declining to express opinions openly; alternate translation: “will shrink from frank exposition.”
^5 “Apotelesmatics” is a technical term for works dealing with the outcomes (effects, results) of astrological configurations.
