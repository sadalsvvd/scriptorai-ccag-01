...fishes; for exercises, in Gemini; for swingings, in Sagittarius; for odoriferous remedies, in Taurus; for phlegm-purging treatments, in Capricorn. According to the sympathy of the observed stars, the proper nourishment should be administered as follows: with Saturn, vegetables; with Hermes (Mercury), poultry; with Ares (Mars), salted fish; with Aphrodite (Venus), odoriferous substances, pickles, poultices, and sippings; wine should be given—whether cool or as an antidote—under Zeus (Jupiter). Under the testimony of Helios (the Sun), emetics and fasting, or even a change of place, changes of regimen, baths, or cuppings are beneficial.

As for the notable hours for incubation (i.e., beginning medical sleep or crisis), during the day: the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 12th hours; during the night: the 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 8th hours. The waxing Moon, at the first quarter, and as it is separating from conjunction at the full moon, brings the end to the afflicted person; but if it is waning, or also proceeding similarly at the first quarter after separating from conjunction, about the time of the full moon it restores matters pertaining to health. When the Moon is configured with Ares (Mars) and Helios (the Sun), being in great motion, it halts the disease and brings danger at the quadrature or aspect; but when thus configured with Kronos (Saturn), it completes diseases without danger. Yet if it is so configured with Kronos while waning, it brings about illnesses of precarious outcome; likewise, with Helios and Ares, when waning or in diminished light, at the quadrature it again brings restoration of health.

Diseases that begin during eclipses of Helios and Selene (the Sun and Moon) tend to be very severe and difficult to guard against. The useful (i.e., favorable) days are safe alongside the benefics, but perilous with the malefics, especially at conjunction (syzygy), full moons, or periods of incubation; for those subject to corruption are greatly consumed by suffering. The risings of Sirius, Orion, and of other prominent stars are advantageous, but their settings are disadvantageous.

When Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, or Pisces is ascending, and the Moon is in them, one should not operate, just as we have said among prohibitions; for spasms will follow. The dodecatemoria (twelfth-parts) of the malefics, and if the Moon falls into these, indicate dangerous and fatal incubations; but those of the benefics signify health. Whenever the Moon, descending from conjunction and encountering a malefic nearby, brings about death by disease.

Thus far we have set forth, sufficiently and here also, what has been said by the ancients concerning incubation.
