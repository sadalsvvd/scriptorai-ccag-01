...Pisces, exercises in Gemini, swingings in Sagittarius, olfactory remedies in Taurus,  
phlegm-purging in Capricorn.^1🤖 According to the sympathy of the observed stars, one ought to take food as follows: under Saturn, vegetables; under Hermes (Mercury), fowl; under Ares (Mars), sargue-fish^2🤖; under Aphrodite (Venus), aromatics, pickled products, poultices, and decoctions^3🤖; for wine, whether cool or antidotal, under Zeus (Jupiter). When the Sun is predominant, vomiting is beneficial, as are bleedings, changes of location or regimen, baths, or evacuations.^4🤖  
The notable hours for resting have been observed: during the day, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 12th hours; and during the night, the 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 8th. The waxing Moon, at its first quarter (first dichotomy)^5🤖, and when it dissolves its bond^6🤖 at the time of the full moon, brings an end for the afflicted.  
But if, during the waning or diminishing phase, it likewise dissolves its bond in the first quarter, then at the full moon it restores health.  
Further, when configured^7🤖 with Mars and the Sun, being strongly activated, it halts the disease and brings danger at the square aspect^8🤖; but when so configured with Saturn, it renders the diseases harmless. But if it is configured with Saturn while subtracting in number^9🤖, it brings about dangerous illnesses; just as with the Sun and Mars, when subtracting in number or in light at the square, it again brings about health.  
Diseases that begin during eclipses of the Sun (Helios) or Moon (Selene) are especially severe and difficult to guard against. The useful days will be safe when the benefic planets are present, but dangerous with the malefics, especially during conjunctions, at the full moon, or during rest; for those declining are greatly worn away miserably.  
The heliacal risings of Sirius, Orion, and the other common stars are propitious, their settings unpropitious.  
When Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, or Pisces are ascending, and the Moon is present in them, one should not attempt surgery, as we have also said regarding the signs of impediment: for spasm will follow. The dodecatemoria^10🤖 of the malefic planets and the Moon, when present in these signs, indicate that periods of rest will be perilous and destructive; those of the benefic planets, health.  
Moreover, whenever the Moon, descending from the bond and coming near a malefic, brings about death by disease. With this, we have sufficiently set forth what has been said by the ancients concerning lying down (recovery from illness).^11🤖  
Explicit. Chapter: "The Pertinent Matters." And if anything should be omitted, it is possible for those who are diligent to discover these, even the things left out, which have been omitted because of the length of the writing.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1🤖 "Phlegm-purging" translates "ἀποφλεγματισμοῖς," signifying therapies aimed at removing phlegm, such as bloodletting, emetics, or expectorants, broadening the scope beyond just "expectorations."
2🤖 "Sargue-fish" renders "σαρεῖν," likely referring to the species Diplodus sargus; some translations generalize as "salted fish," but "sargue-fish" preserves the observed ancient specificity.
3🤖 "Aromatics" translates "ὀσφρητικοῖς" (olfactory remedies); "pickled products" for "ὀπῤας," "poultices" for "καταπλάσμασι," and "decoctions" (or drinks) for "ῥοφήμασιν."
4🤖 The list combines several interventions (vomiting, bleedings, changes of location or regimen, baths, evacuations) recommended when the Sun is predominant.
5🤖 "First quarter (first dichotomy)" clarifies that the technical astrological phase referred to is the Moon's first quarter.
6🤖 The "bond" ("σύνδεσμος") is a technical astrological aspect, possibly referring to close conjunction or key lunar phases.
7🤖 "Configured with"—"συσχηματίζομαι"—is the standard astrological term for planets forming a specific aspect.
8🤖 "Square aspect" (Greek "τετράγωνον") refers to a 90° angle, traditionally called "quartile" in astrology.
9🤖 "Subtracting in number" refers to the Moon's waning phase, a decrease in light or motion after full moon.
10🤖 "Dodecatemoria" are twelfth-parts of zodiacal signs, a fine subdivision used in ancient astrology, significant in prognostication.
11🤖 "Lying down (recovery from illness)" translates "κατακλίσις," a technical term for periods of critical rest or crisis in disease, not just the literal act of reclining.
