APPENDIX 163

twelfth, 2nd and 6th. Jupiter: 12 years, twelfth—1st; Mars: 15 years, twelfth—1st and 4th; Venus: 8 years, twelfth—eight months; Mercury: 20 years, twelfth—1st and 6th.

<50>. How one may learn the positions^1🤖 of the zodiacal signs and the hours of the climates. When, in the third climate—since its greatest period is from Cancer to Sagittarius, comprising 210 years, and its least period is from Capricorn to Gemini, comprising 103 years—if you divide these by 15, the equinoctial hourly units, then the longest day is 19 equinoctial hours and the shortest is 10. One must take a sixth part of each of the greatest and least periods: a sixth of 210, the greatest, is 35; of 103, the least, is about 17. There remains a remainder, about 1, which can be further divided as needed. This gives the increment or decrement^2🤖 for each zodiacal sign. In the same way, you will learn about the other climates.

<51>. Concerning the greatest years and the complete restitutions of the seven planets. Saturn completes its greatest restitution in 457 years; Jupiter, in 427 years; Mars, in 384 years; the Sun, in 1,457 years; Venus, in 1,251 years; Mercury, in 489 years; the Moon, in 25 years. The restitution of the cosmos occurs in 109,830 years, and then all the stars are in conjunction at the 30th degree of Cancer or the 1st degree of Leo, and completion takes place; but at Cancer there is a flood, in a part of the cosmos.

<52>. Concerning the planets without aspect^3🤖 in relation to the lights. When the Moon, being without aspect to the Sun, is found, it brings about separation, instability, or alienation of parents; and if the Moon is without aspect to Saturn, on the one hand it may be the cause of good births, but also of reversals and afflictions.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Positions" translates προθέσεις, which can refer to starting points, settings, or initial placements, especially in a technical astrological context.

^2🤖 The Greek "αὐξεμείωσις" means "increase and decrease"; here rendered as "increment or decrement" for each zodiacal sign. "Variation" is also possible.

^3🤖 The Greek term ἀσύνδετος ("without aspect") denotes a planet not in a traditional observable aspect (angular relationship) to another, often rendered as "asyndetic" or "unconnected" in technical literature.
