...if a star is found in the house of a benefic and within the bounds of a benefic, and the bounds of a benefic have an influence on the nativity, the fortune is that of a benefic; but if it is found in the house of a benefic yet in the bounds of a malefic, the goodness of the fortune is diminished; and if it happens in the house of a malefic and in the bounds of a malefic, the fortune is bad and obscure.

54. — if L. 201, 1 for "apotelesmatourgia." 4 for "the recollection." r. 5 "the contributing—only" omitted. r. "the bounds of it contribute only in their own outcomes." L. 6 "the" L, "then the" r. 8 "the very ones" r. 9 "these" r. 10 "he was compelled" r.

13. On the ascensions of the seven climes.

Ptolemy precisely determined the ascensions of the seven climes by thorough investigation, and we need these in all genethlialogical methods as he determined in his handy canon; but the Egyptians and Valens determined the seven climes less precisely, yet actively, and we need these in the risings of the zodiacal signs and of the stars for each clime, as Valens says in his own Apotelesmata (Results).*

14. On the melothesia (bodily rulership) of the zodiacal signs.

This is a chapter of Porphyry, p. 201. I have noted these from codex L: p. 201, 12 “the melothesiai of humans” L. 14 “the sinews” L (for “the sinews,” cf. Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos III, 17). 15 “of the lots” L. 16 “of them” L. and 20 “there” L. 19 “having made it clear” L. “kata” [κατά] is also found in L.

15. On the triangles, squares, diameters, and the other figures bearing a relation to each other as in the form of diameters.

This is a chapter of Porphyry p. 201 following. In manuscripts L and r I have found various readings: p. 201, 24 “configuration” L. 25 “have been constituted three” r.; “and greater” and “of all” omitted r. 26 “according to — as we have demonstrated” omitted r. 28 “we will show” L.; after “chronike,” r provides: “as some determined regarding the ascensions of the signs; but the third, etc.” 29 “an” [ἂν] rightly omitted r. 30 “determined” L, r. 31 “and of the ascensions” L. 32 “and the general” [reading: “the general” L; “the new” r.] “the universal is called” 30 r. “kata eis” [κατὰ εἷς] L. “kata—let us go astray” omitted r. 34 “the one of the sun” r. 35 “appeared” [“was wondered at” L, r] “prosunelion” [προσῆλιον] L. 37 “broadly” [“harmfully” r].

1 “is found” omitted r.; “in” supplied. “house of a benefic” r. 2 "to r."—“and” L. “fortune” [“soul” r.] “if” I have written: “whether” L, r. “in” supplied. “house” omitted r. 4 “and” omitted r. 5 “to the fortune” L; “to the soul” r. 10 Cf. Ptolemy and Theon's tables, ed. Halma, II, 2 sqq. 13 “Valens” in codices. 15 “risings” L, “in his own Apotelesmata as he says” L. 22 In codex π the chapter is so inscribed: “On the side of the triangular, square, and hexagonal figures”; in codex r: “On the triangular, square, and hexagonal [figures] as in the form of diameters.”
