LLM Translation Footnotes
-------------------------

^1🤖 In the first entry, "Set the horoscope—grief for him," “grief” (λύπη) has been rendered to reflect the technical prognostication in Greek horary astrology.
^2🤖 "Phlebotomy" is the historically precise term for bloodletting; the Moon’s "fortune" refers to its astrological house or lot.
^3🤖 “Question” as a noun maintains the inquiry’s theme; “about” preserves the nuance of imminent asking.
^4🤖 “Thought” and “the property of the place” correspond to inner cognitive activity and characteristic qualities of a house or position, as commonly rendered in ancient astrological texts.
^5🤖 “Reason for the question” is the standard translation, and “Dorotheus” and “Apomasar” refer to historical authorities.
^6🤖 “Wise or foolish” preserves the typical ancient doublet (σοφός/ἄφρων); “inquirer” is standard terminological English in astrology.
^7🤖 “Disease” rather than “illness” takes precedence for formal precision.
^8🤖 Some authorities (likely unnamed in the original) are cited with alternative doctrines—hence "some said."
^9🤖 “Govern” is conventional terminology for planetary influence; “kinds” reflects categories governed.
^10🤖 “Adverse things” is chosen for objectivity, over "terrible things."
^11🤖 “Character of persons derived from the decans” reflects the technical structure of astrological attributions to decanal divisions.
^12🤖 “Shining forth” is preferred for the Greek epiphainō, indicating superior visibility or influence.
^13🤖 “He will obtain” is retained as the succinct pronouncement.
^14🤖 “Fire-leading stars” (ὑπερπύρια) is preserved as a technical term; see note for context.
^15🤖 “Disputes” is the likely outcome forecast concerning debt, from the usual astrological idiom.
^16🤖 The term “brothers” is kept as a direct rendering; ambiguity about which brother or number reflects the Greek.
^17🤖 “Household matters” covers the purview better than “real estate” or “property.”
^18🤖 “Dependents” (παροίκων) is broader than “tenants” and includes various estate attachments; “Masāllah” is the commonly accepted scholarly spelling.
