LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The word "chronocrator" (χρονοκράτωρ) is left untranslated as it is a technical term in astrology referring to the planetary ruler of a given period.
^2🤖 "Will not be moved" renders a phrase that may carry the nuance of "will not be disturbed" or "changed," depending on specific astrological context.
^3🤖 "Lots" (κλῆροι) are technical points cast in Hellenistic astrology, sometimes called "Parts" (Latin pars); these indicate significant fortunes or topics.
^4🤖 "Sun" and "Ascendant" are preserved for precise astrological reference.
^5🤖 "k–ltʹ" refers to a range of lots, using Greek numerals for 20–39; the prime (ʹ) is retained to reflect Greek manuscript conventions.
^6🤖 "Decan of the Ascendant" is a technical astrological phrase; consult an astrology glossary for nuances.
^8🤖 "Money" is used unless the context or Greek requires the more specific "silver."
^10🤖 The arithmetic here reflects astrological calculation; "up to one hundred <sic>" retains manuscript notation and possible numerical ambiguity.
^16🤖 Rendered as "camel’s felt cap"; alternative: "camel-hair hood."
^20🤖 "The excluded" can also be read as "those who have been shut out," depending on interpretive preference.
^21🤖 "Maleficent influences" is standard in astrological scholarship for harmful planetary or cosmic effects, as opposed to personal agents.
