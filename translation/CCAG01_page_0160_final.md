17. On sympathetic and unsympathetic squares.

The zodiacal signs that are in a relationship of sympathy with one another along a square zodiacal side are these: Taurus with Aquarius, and Leo with Scorpio on account of the equality of bearing; again, Leo with Taurus, and Scorpio with Aquarius on account of their equivalence; and Gemini with Virgo, and Sagittarius with Pisces on account of their similar belts. All the other squares are useless for sympathy. Now every square side is constituted by 90 degrees, and the hexagonal (trine) by 60 degrees—for four times 90, and six times 60; the diameter by 180 degrees, for twice 180 makes 360, as the entire circle has so many degrees.

18. On the dodecatemoria of the stars.

The dodecatemoria of the degrees of the stars, the ancients set forth in three ways: Paulus, in his Introduction, said to take the star’s degrees equal to thirteen and to project from the same sign by increments of 30 degrees, and wherever the count arrives, in that sign is the dodecatemorion of the star. Dorotheus, in the eleventh book, says to take the degrees from twelve; Ptolemy, in the twenty-sixth chapter of the first book, said to project half the degrees from two for each sign. But I have found rather by experience that the method of Dorotheus is in agreement with that of Ptolemy; and these methods I agree with more—the one from twelve, and the one from half two; for thus both methods arrive at the same sign, as, for example: the Moon happened to be in Taurus, 25 degrees; making these twelve times, I found 300 degrees; I projected these from Taurus by increments of 30 degrees and it ended in Aquarius, 30 degrees, to complete the signs; again, those same 25 degrees I projected from Tau‑

Cap. 17 in codices n and r is continuous with what precedes (without a heading). In codex m it is titled: On the zodiacal signs sympathetic towards each other along the square side.  
2 Again, then, some... hexagonal... 3 from x and on account of the equality of bearing omitted by r.  
5 Again—Aquarius and Taurus with Scorpio added; squares omitted by r.  
7 for towards by r; happen to be omitted by most;  
8 to be constituted q; and also six times 60, 360 omitted by Ltr.

degrees omitted by q.  
11 On the calculation of the dodecatemoria see Scaliger ad Manilium, ed. 1665, p. 162.  
13 Paulus Alexandrinus praises the chapter on the dodecatemorion fol. H 4v.  
17 This was the final book of the work: see above, p. 82, what Olivieri transcribed from Masala’s treatise: Dorotheus (set forth) eleven books: four on nativities, three on questions, three on calculations, and one on conjunctions. But in the text of Rhetorius I think it should read “for eleven”; for a chapter on dodecatemoria does not fit well in the book on conjunctions, but rather with the books on calculations. — The same method as Dorotheus is followed by Manilius, II, 725ff.; Firmicus, II, 13; Hephaestio, I, 18. Anonymous commentary on Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, p. 48 (where Dorotheus is also cited).  
17 See Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, I, 22, ed. 1535, fol. 13v, 26. Yet, in fact, Ptolemy does not accept the doctrine of the dodecatemoria, but rather removes all their force. The method explained by Ptolemy is described by anonymous commentaries on Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, p. 47ff. and in Porphyry’s Introduction, p. 194.
