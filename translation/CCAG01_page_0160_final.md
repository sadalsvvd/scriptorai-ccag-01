17. On sympathetic and antipathetic tetragons.

Now, the pairs of signs that possess sympathy toward each other along the zodiacal tetragonal side^1🤖 are as follows: Taurus toward Aquarius, and Leo toward Scorpio, on account of the paranalogy^2🤖; again, Leo toward Taurus, and Scorpio toward Aquarius, on account of their equipotency; and Gemini toward Virgo, and Sagittarius toward Pisces, on account of the equality of the yoke (‘homozōnia’)^3🤖. All other tetragonal aspects are altogether useless for sympathy. Moreover, each tetragonal side consists of 90 degrees, the hexagonal of 60 degrees, since four times 90 and six times 60, and the diameter of 180 degrees, for twice 180 amounts to 360, as the whole circle comprises that many degrees.

18. On the dodecatemoria of the stars.

The ancients set forth the dodecatemoria of the degrees of the stars in three ways. Paulus, in his Introduction, states that one is to make the degrees of the star equal by 13 and to advance them from the same sign in intervals of 30 degrees; and wherever the count ends, in that sign is the dodecatemorion of the star. Dorotheus, on the other hand, states in the eleventh book that the degrees are to be taken in 12s; Ptolemy, in the twenty-sixth chapter of the first book, says that the degrees are to be halved in each sign^4🤖. But I, from experience, have found the method of Dorotheus more concordant with that of Ptolemy; and I rather concur with these methods—namely, those by 12, and those by two and a half—for thus the two methods reach the same sign, as in the following example: Suppose the Moon is in Taurus, at the 25th degree; multiplying this by twelve I found 300 degrees; advancing these from Taurus by 30 degrees each, it ended in Aquarius, at the 30th degree, for the completion of the signs. Again, I advance these 25 degrees from Tau—

In codices n and r, this chapter continues directly from the previous (the heading is absent). In codex m, it is titled: On signs that are sympathetic to one another along the tetragonal side.

17. This was the last book of the work: see above, p. 82, what Olivieri transcribed from Masala’s treatise: Dorotheus (set forth) eleven books: four on nativities, three on questions, three on calculation, and one on conjunctions. But in the text of Rhetorius I think that it should read “for the eleventh”; for the chapter on dodecatemoria does not fit the book on conjunctions, but rather the books on calculation. — The same method as Dorotheus is followed by Manilius, II, 725ff.; Firmicus, II, 13; Hephaestio, I, 18. Anonymous commentary on Plotinus’ Tetrabiblos, p. 48 (where Dorotheus is likewise praised).  
17. See Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos, I, 22, ed. 1535, fol. 13v, 26. However, Ptolemy does not approve the doctrine of the dodecatemoria, but in fact utterly abolishes their effectiveness. The method transmitted by Ptolemy is related by anonymous commentaries on Plotinus’ Tetrabiblos, p. 47ff., and Porphyry’s Introduction, p. 194.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Tetragonal side" here refers to the 90-degree angular relation between zodiacal signs, the "square aspect" in astrological terminology.  
^2🤖 "Paranalogy" (παραναλογία) is a technical term in astrology denoting a parallel or analogous relationship between signs.  
^3🤖 "Equality of the yoke" translates the Greek term ὁμοζωνία (homozōnia), indicating an affinity or parity—sometimes rendered as "like-yoked."  
^4🤖 The Greek phrase underlying Ptolemy’s method is disputed; it may mean "to advance the degrees by half for each sign," i.e., a calculation involving dividing the number of degrees by 2 for each zodiacal sign. Scholarly debate persists about the precise method intended.
