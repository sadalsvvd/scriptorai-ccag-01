LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The word found as “δυνά” in the manuscript is likely a corruption of “δεινά” (“misfortunes”) and is retained here as “dyna” (read: “deina,” i.e., “misfortunes”) to signal the textual note and probable meaning.

^2🤖 The Greek phrase "οὐδεὶς τῶν ἐπιστημόνων πάντα ὅσα οἱ διδάσκον <sic> τὴν οἰκίαν πραγματευόμενος τιμὴν" is apparently corrupt and elliptical. It is rendered here as "none of the scholars possesses everything that those teaching household management as a business...honor," and the ellipsis marks unresolved textual ambiguity; the syntax is irregular and likely defective.

^3🤖 Daimon (δαίμων) here refers to an astrological lot and is left untranslated to preserve technical meaning.

^4🤖 The Greek interjection is “Ποταπῶς;” (Potapōs? “How?”), a textual feature noted in some lists.

^5🤖 The Greek phrase includes the note "<l.-ων>," marking a possible correction from a corrupt word, probably ἄρχων (“ruler”). The translation as "for how many years the ruler rules" reflects both the literal meaning and manuscript context.
