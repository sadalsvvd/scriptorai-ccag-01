PREFACE

After the sixteenth century, when learned superstition—following the teachings of Ptolemy and Paul of Alexandria—endeavored to discern the effects of the stars, the writings of the Greek astrologers, amassed in libraries over three centuries, lay neglected and almost universally scorned. Those works composed in verse were the only ones to be meticulously edited by philologists, not on account of their subject matter, but because of their poetic form. Once the emptiness of mendacious doctrine had been exposed, no one dared to indulge in the deceptions of the false prophets, and that entire art, along with the books by which it was taught, was consigned to oblivion. Yet, while scholars appeared to regain their senses, they in fact began to grow dull; for the errors, long sustained, of past ages are no less necessary to the understanding of human affairs than their most illustrious discoveries. Indeed, if one were to remove astrology—which, under the rule of the Caesars, almost everyone adhered to—much concerning both the religion and the sciences of those times could not rightly be grasped. But if, on the other hand, you were to accomplish what is surely a most difficult task: to investigate the origins of that ancient learning cultivated among the peoples of the East, to explain the remarkable spread of that imported discipline among the Greeks and Romans, scarcely—indeed, hardly at all—can the mind even foresee how greatly the culture and customs of antiquity might be illuminated thereby. But I do not wish to say more, lest I seem—after the fashion of soothsayers—to entice my readers with promises of seas and mountains. Rather, this undertaking ought to be commended by deeds rather than words. What our purpose is, and how it has come about that

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 I have rendered “doctrinae mendacis vanitate patefacta pseudoprophetarum fallaciis nemo indulgere ausus est” as “Once the emptiness of mendacious doctrine had been exposed, no one dared to indulge in the deceptions of the false prophets,” to preserve both the sense and emphasis, though alternate readings are possible.

^2🤖 "dum resipiscere sibi videntur viri docti, potius hebescere coeperunt" is translated as "while scholars appeared to regain their senses, they in fact began to grow dull"; the phrase is somewhat ironic, noting a decline in critical spirit where one might expect progress.

^3🤖 In "maria montesque pollicitus," the phrase alludes to extravagant promises; I have kept "seas and mountains" to retain the original imagery.
