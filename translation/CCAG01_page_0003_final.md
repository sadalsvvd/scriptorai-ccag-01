The works that were composed in verse alone were edited with care by philologists, not on account of their subject matter but for their poetic form.

Yet, while men of learning appeared to be recovering their senses, they in fact began to grow duller, since the errors of a previous age, long sustained, are no less necessary for the understanding of human affairs than are the brightest discoveries. Indeed, if one were to remove astrology, to which nearly all were devoted under the reign of the Caesars, then many things, both in the religion and in the sciences of that period, could not be rightly understood. But if, by chance, you have achieved the exceedingly difficult task of tracing out the ancient origins of mathematical science as it was cultivated among the Orientals, of explaining the marvelous growth of that grafted discipline among the Greeks and Romans, scarcely—and hardly at all—can the mind foresee how much the religion and customs of antiquity might thus be illuminated. But I do not wish to say more, lest I seem, like a soothsayer, to entice readers with promises of seas and mountains. It is proper that this undertaking be recommended by deeds rather than by words.
