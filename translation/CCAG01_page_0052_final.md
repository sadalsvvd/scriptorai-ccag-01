LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 For phrases such as “<sic>,” I have preserved the manuscript's apparent errors or ambiguities, as indicated by the transcriber.  
^2🤖 In “Concerning how to know… without acting, to say which is good and which is bad…” the Greek verb δρῶντός is ambiguous, but in this context, it appears to mean “without acting/intervening”, as in making a passive judgment.  
^3🤖 “Ascendant” is used to translate ὡροσκόπος, the technical term for the horoscope or rising sign in astrology.  
^4🤖 “Lots” translates κλῆρος, a technical astrological term indicating casting of lots or calculated points, not a lottery.  
^5🤖 “F. xx” refers to folio (page) numbering in the manuscript, not to chapters or sections. Titling conventions are preserved for scholarly orientation.  
^6🤖 Parenthetical expressions such as “—in a place,” “—Jupiter,” etc., indicate brief manuscript summaries or references to the body of text. These have been translated as tersely as in the original to preserve the table-of-contents style.  
^7🤖 “Concerning the beginning (Pay attention at every beginning—[whether] bad),” where φαύλων likely refers to unfortunate or bad beginnings, in keeping with astrological practice.  
^8🤖 “Otherwise (Know that—both).” The meaning is terse in the original; I have preserved this ambiguity.  
^9🤖 The translation stops mid-sentence at “when not…”, as the sentence continues onto the next page.
