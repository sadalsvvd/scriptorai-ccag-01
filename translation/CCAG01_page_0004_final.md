VI

FLORENTINE MANUSCRIPTS

Since, in the case of a short treatise bearing a title under which the names of four authors are found, a brief clarification will suffice, let us proceed. When I began to examine the manuscripts of astrologers so that from that mass I might extract what pertains to the religion of the Romans, I soon realized that this undertaking would be fruitless unless the raw and unorganized material were first arranged, and the ancient and genuine elements distinguished from the commentaries of more recent times. Therefore, I set out to compile catalogues of books of this kind. But when I made my friends participants in my plan, I learned that others had conceived and even attempted the same idea. It thus seemed best to join forces in order to tackle this laborious task, so that it might be carried out more perfectly, and full agreement was readily reached concerning both the collective endeavor and its individual parts. We intend to complete in detail a catalogue, arranged according to the places where they are kept, of all the extant Greek astrological manuscripts. Already, nearly all the books of the Marciana, and a great part of the collections in Munich, Vienna, Paris, and Rome, have been described, and within a few years we hope that our begun enterprise will be brought to completion. When the work is finished, copious indices will point out the way for researchers in the forest of collected materials. In this way, for the establishment of a corpus of Greek astrologers—which is our aim—at least the firmest possible foundations will have been laid.

The method which we have decided to follow in compiling this catalogue can already be discerned from the first book, which now appears publicly. The first part contains a most complete inventory of manuscripts, in which known astrological works are mentioned as briefly as possible; anonymous excerpts, however, are listed individually, with the names of the author, if it has been possible to ascertain, or of the editor, if already published, and the first and last words are transcribed. In the appendix, the principal fragments are published, or rather those for which copies have been available to us. For, pressed by the constraints of time and at a great distance from libraries, we have not been able to obtain all that it would have been useful to bring forth from their recesses.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 On “bearing a title under which the names of four authors are found”: The Latin phrase is elliptical but refers to a particular small work with four attributed authors. The impersonal, introductory style is preserved.

^2🤖 “Manuscripts” is used as a general term for handwritten books, in preference to the more technical “codices.”

^3🤖 "Religion of the Romans" is a more idiomatic rendering of "religionem Romanorum" than the literal “Roman religion.”

^4🤖 The phrase "raw and unorganized material" reflects the Latin "rudis et inconcinnus," capturing both metaphors.

^5🤖 "Marciana" is the accurate name for the Library of St Mark's (Venice) in English scholarly use; collections are referenced rather than just “books” to clarify scope.

^6🤖 The “forest of collected materials” renders “silva collectaneorum,” a common Latin metaphor for a vast, dense compilation.

^7🤖 "Appears publicly" renders "in publicum exit," a standard Latin phrase for “is published.”

^8🤖 The tense “have been available” (present perfect) is used for ongoing relevance.

^9🤖 "Pressed by the constraints of time and at a great distance from libraries" is the closest idiomatic English to "temporis angustiis pressi et a bibliothecis longe remotis."

^10🤖 Throughout, the choice was made to prefer clarity, fluency, and accurate rendering of Latin metaphors and syntax, with deference to academic English norms.
