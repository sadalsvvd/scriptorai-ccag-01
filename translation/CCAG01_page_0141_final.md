...gloom; but in temperate signs, the condition is temperate and windless, making the sea calm, benefiting the animals, and abundantly nourishing and increasing the crops, especially when the other stars are also configured in harmony with it.

The star of Zeus lies beneath the zone of Kronos, after that of Ares, being intermediate between both and situated in temperate air; for, partaking from Kronos of a colder disposition and from Ares a fiery and warmer quality^1🤖, it becomes temperate by nature, and is established as beneficent and sympathetic toward all things^2🤖; for this reason, it is also the cause of generation^3🤖. Thus, when it is in signs sympathetic to it, it renders the air temperate and likewise the outpourings of waters^4🤖 temperate, provides health to the animals, and makes the sea calm; but when in signs unsympathetic to it, it makes the air turbulent and gloomy, the dispositions pestilential, and the outpourings of waters untimely and unhelpful, accompanied by hail and winds, and renders the sea unsettled.

The star of Ares lies beneath the zone of Zeus, after that of the Sun, in an air that is fiery and suffocating. For, partaking of a fiery exhalation from Zeus and a hot emanation from the Sun^5🤖, it becomes of a fiery nature for this very reason—that is, because of its proximity to the Sun; whence, it becomes destructive to all things generated upon the earth, both animals and crops of every kind, because of its excessive fiery force. Thus, when it is in signs sympathetic to it, it brings storms of lightning and droughts, and renders the air fiery, pestilential, heavy, and noxious, and the condition warlike and turbulent^6🤖, and is destructive in all respects; but when in signs unsympathetic to it, it makes the air temperate and clear, renders the sea calm, the animals uninjured, unvictimized, and undisturbed^7🤖, and brings the crops to fruition.

The Sun lies beneath the zone of Ares, after that of Aphrodite, being central among all^8🤖, fiery by nature, but containing within itself the substance of the whole, mingled by the nature of the elements, king and...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 On “fiery and warmer quality”: The Greek terms likely indicate both “fiery” (πυρώδης) and “warm/hot” (θερμὴ), with “warmer quality” preserving nuance without redundancy.

^2🤖 “Sympathetic” (συμπαθής) is a technical astrological term for a harmonious or congenial relationship; “beneficent and sympathetic” captures the planet’s traditionally positive influence.

^3🤖 “Cause of generation” (ζωογονία): More literally “cause of the generation of life,” a standard phrase in ancient cosmology for vital influence.

^4🤖 “Outpourings of waters” (ἐκχύσεις τῶν ὑδάτων): A standard ancient phrase for rainfall or precipitation.

^5🤖 “Fiery exhalation” and “hot emanation” correspond to ancient concepts of atmospheric qualities (ἀνάθυμα and ἀπόρροια), common in astrological texts.

^6🤖 “Condition warlike and turbulent”: The Greek is often “κατάστασις πολεμική,” suggesting a climate or era of strife and agitation.

^7🤖 “Unvictimized” (ἀπολέμητα) is rare and difficult; here it conveys not being subjected to attack or harm, especially in the context of animals’ wellbeing.

^8🤖 “Central among all” translates “μέσος ὤν πάντων,” indicating cosmological centrality. Some versions read “midway of all,” but “central among all” is more idiomatic in English.
