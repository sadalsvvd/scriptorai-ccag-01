LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 For the opening, "they will be diminished outside," I have chosen "diminished" over "decreased" for idiomatic clarity in English, per astrological phrasing.  
^2🤖 For "Saturn received by lot—the tame beasts," the translation reflects the standard astrological association of Saturn (Greek Cronos) with "tame" or hand-reared animals (from χειροῆθη), not wild.  
^3🤖 For "according to the method of the divine Ptolemy, which we find to be almost always true," the phrase balances the literal sense and the frequent encomiastic use of "divine" (θεῖος) for Ptolemy.  
^4🤖 "From the degrees of the ascensions, thirty-five years are reckoned" stays close to the technical astrological calculation, as opposed to the less precise "climacteric numbers."  
^5🤖 "According to the philosopher Heliodorus" is the standard translation for "κατὰ τὸν φιλόσοφον Ἡλιόδωρον."  
^6🤖 For "that which is without offspring," I retain the literal sense; some may interpret this idiomatically as "the unlucky" or "unproductive."  
^7🤖 "Synoptic Exposition" renders συνοπτική, meaning a summary or comprehensive outline.  
^8🤖 "Phenomena are produced in relation to the Sun by the wandering stars—" preserves the technical structure and incomplete sentence from the manuscript, marking continuation on the next folio.
