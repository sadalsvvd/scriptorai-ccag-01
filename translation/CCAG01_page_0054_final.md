LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term “releaser” translates the technical Greek ἀφέτης (plural ἀφεταί, aphetae), a planet or point that “releases” or rules periods of life in Hellenistic astrology.
^2🤖 The word σίνην (variant σῖνη) can mean “destruction” or “damage” in technical astrological usage; context-specific.
^3🤖 The reference to “fresoi” is ambiguous; it may denote “organs” or another technical term (possibly a scribal error or rare usage).
^4🤖 “Introduced” (Greek: εἰσακτός) literally means “brought in”; can refer to an adopted child, a concubine, or a woman introduced into the household. Ambiguity persists in specialized legal and astrological contexts.
^5🤖 Greek ἀκτινοβολία refers to the “projection of rays” or aspects between planets in astrology. Alternate renderings include “ray-casting” or “emission of rays.”
^6🤖 The “twelfth-part” doctrine (Greek: δωδεκατημόριον) is a technical Hellenistic astrological teaching involving the subdivision of zodiacal signs or degrees into twelfth-parts.
