…and some are amphibious, some are prolific of seed, some are few-bearing, some are barren, some are lascivious, some are pure, some are enigmatic, some are monstrous, some are arched, some are honey-producing, some are quadrupeds, some are dual-formed, some are many-limbed, some are social, some are bicolored, some are epileptic, some are soft-bodied, some are weak-sighted, some are convulsive, some are servile, some are bestial, some are anthropomorphic, some are winged, some are vocalic, some are semi-vocalic, <some are mute>.

Now, since this is so, the ruling signs are Aries, Leo, and Saturn; and they are called “ruling” because these are said to belong to the Sun and Jupiter, and it is clear that these are the rulers among the rest of the stars. The co-ruling signs are Jupiter, Saturn, and the Moon. These are called “co-ruling” because they belong to Saturn and Mercury, but they have less power than the ruling signs of the Sun and Jupiter. The subordinate signs are the feminine ones: Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pisces; for those who have the luminaries in these at the time of birth, when not centralized or attended by benefics, will be subject to rulers, and will be unfortunate and poor. The terrestrial signs are Cancer, Taurus, Jupiter, Leo, Libra, and Virgo. For, in general indications, eclipses of the Sun and Moon occurring in these, as well as the phases of the planets, and the stations regarding terrestrial animals, indicate, according to their qualities, the good or bad events about to occur; (cf. 94r) and similarly, the aquatic signs pertain to the sea, rivers, lakes, and the fishes inhabiting them.

But so as not to be verbose by addressing each type individually, let an example suffice. For instance, when we are considering the matter of rulership, and Fortune is rising or culminating in Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, and these are attended by the supporting stars of the sect, royal and ruling dignities come about; but if the stars of the co-ruling triangle are so placed, then dignity results to a lesser degree, and to a still lesser degree for the subordinate triangle. In inquiries concerning marriage, the lascivious and the pure signs are to be noted; in inquiries concerning children, the prolific signs; in the place regarding disease, the arched, the leprous, and the enigmatic signs: for as the stars making aspects are, so do they lessen or intensify the corresponding indications, and likewise for the others—this must be applied analogously in accordance with the designation, both in universal usage and in the nativity, and even in matters of beginnings. Aquatic are called those which are in water, by water, or partake of water: Pisces, Cancer, Virgo, Saturn; of these, Pisces and Cancer are in water, while Virgo and Saturn are so in part—Virgo on account of its extremities in the heavens; Saturn...
