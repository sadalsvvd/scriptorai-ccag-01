...some are amphibious, some are prolific in seeds, some are prolific in offspring, some produce few offspring, some are barren, some are lustful, some are pure, some enigmatic, some monstrous, some convex-shaped, some honey-producing, some quadrupedal, some dual-formed, some have an excess of limbs, some are social, some are two-colored, some are epileptic, some produce mollusks, some are weak-sighted, some are spasmodic, some are servile, some are bestial, some are anthropomorphic, some are winged, some are vocalic, some are semivocalic, <some are voiceless>.

Now, with these things so constituted, the ruling (hegemonic) ones are: Aries (♈), Leo (♌), and Saturn (♄). They are called "ruling" because these are said to belong to the Sun and to Zeus^1🤖, and it is clear that these preside over the other stars. The sub-rulers (parēgemonika) are Jupiter (♃), Saturn (♄), and the Moon (☽). They are described as "sub-rulers" because they happen to belong to Kronos and Hermes^2🤖, and these are inferior in power to the Sun and Zeus. The submissive (hypotaktika) ones are the feminine signs: Taurus (♉), Cancer (♋), Virgo (♍), Capricorn (♑), Pisces (♓), since those having the luminaries in them at birth, unless they are centered or attended by benefics, will be made subject to masters, and unfortunate, and poor. The terrestrial signs are Cancer (♋), Taurus (♉), Uranus (♅), Jupiter (♃), Leo (♌), Libra (♎), Virgo (♍). For, in universal indications, the eclipses of the Sun and Moon happening in these, and likewise the phases of the planets and the settings, in reference to terrestrial animals, signify, regarding what is to come, good or bad events in respect to their quality^3🤖; likewise, the aquatic signs pertain to the sea and rivers and lakes and the fishes dwelling therein.

But lest we prolong the discussion by speaking about each kind individually, let it suffice for us to clarify by way of an example what is being said. For instance, when we consider the matter of honor, and fortune has Aries (♈) or Leo (♌) or Sagittarius (♐) rising or culminating—these, attended by the planets of the chosen sect—confer royal and ruling dignities. When the stars are situated in the triangle of the sub-ruler in this way, the kind of dignity is lessened^4🤖; for that of the submissive triangle, even more so. And in the house concerning marriage, the lustful and pure signs are to be observed; in the one concerning children, those prolific in offspring; in that concerning disease, the convex-shaped, leprous, and enigmatic signs: for the stars configured thus either impede or intensify what is indicated—and similarly for the rest, according to the analogy of the onomatopoeic designation, as applies to the universal custom, the nativity, and also that concerning inceptions. The aquatic signs are called such as are in water, or by water, or possess some part of water: Pisces (♓), Cancer (♋), Virgo (♍), Saturn (♄); in water properly: Pisces (♓), Cancer (♋); in part: Virgo (♍) and Saturn (♄)—Virgo because of its celestial (nature); Saturn...

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 Zeus is rendered here rather than Jupiter to match the Greek pantheon and to retain the original flavor; in some translations, the Roman equivalents are used for clarity within astrological tradition.
2. ^2🤖 Kronos is Saturn, and Hermes is Mercury; again, the Greek names are retained for fidelity to the original text. Some translations opt for their Latin planetary names.
3. ^3🤖 "in reference to terrestrial animals" renders the Greek "περὶ τὰ χερσαία ζῷα," which can also be interpreted as "with regard to terrestrial animals/matters." In the astrological context, this broadly signifies earthly affairs affected by celestial phenomena.
4. ^4🤖 The phrase "the triangle of the sub-ruler in this way, the kind of dignity is lessened" reflects the technical term "triangle" (trigon), often used for "triplicity" in astrology. The implication is that dignity is reduced when associated planets occupy these signs. Alternate translation: "the triangle of the sub-ruler thereby brings the dignity to a lower degree."
