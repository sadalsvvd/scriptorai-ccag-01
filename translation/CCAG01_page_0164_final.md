31. On Counter-Dispositorship (Antanalypsis)

Counter-dispositorship (Antanalypsis) occurs when the diurnal planets possess the places of the nocturnal ones and the nocturnal planets those of the diurnal—or when stars situated in the signs operate favorably, but the rulers (lords) of those signs are debilitated and ineffective.^1🤖

32. On Mutual Reception

Mutual reception is said to occur when, in the signs where the planets are situated, one possesses exaltation and the other domicile.^2🤖

33. On House Lordship (Oikodespotes)

A planet is called the house lord (oikodespotes) when it holds the greatest number of dignities—domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term, or face (decan)—in a given sign.^3🤖

34. On Adherence (Kollēsis)

Adherence (kollēsis) is the strictest form of application, which occurs whenever a swifter planet draws near to a slower one, provided they are not more than three degrees apart.^4🤖

35. On Application (Synaphē)

Application (synaphē) of the Moon is when she is within a day's journey (in degree) of forming a synodic conjunction.

36. On Intervention at Midpoint (Mesembolēsis)

Intervention at midpoint (mesembolēsis) occurs when a star casts its rays into the middle degrees separating two planets as they apply to each other.

37. On Variation (Parallagē)

Variation (parallagē) occurs when one star moves away from the degree of another star, either by bodily separation (i.e., ending conjunction) or by aspect.

38. On Bond (Syndesmos)

The Moon is said to be in bond (syndesmos) when she is within fifteen degrees of the Sun; she is released from it when, after departing, she is separated from the Sun by the same number of degrees. The same is said at Full Moon: when she is within fifteen degrees before Full Moon, she is in bond; after receding the same distance past Full Moon, she is released.^5🤖

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek ἀνταναλύσις (antanalypsis) denotes a technical condition where planets exchange signs (places), or when the signs themselves are favorable but their rulers are weakened—an idea also known in modern astrology as "mutual disposition" or "counter-dispositorship."  
^2🤖 “Mutual reception” is the standard English term for the condition where two planets are in each other's signs of exaltation and domicile.  
^3🤖 "Oikodespotes" (οἰκοδεσπότης) here refers to the planet with the greatest dignity in a sign, calculated by residence and essential dignities: domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term, and face/decan.  
^4🤖 "Adherence" or "kollēsis" denotes an especially close form of approach (application) within three degrees—the Greek emphasizes contact between faster and slower-moving planets.  
^5🤖 "Bond" (syndesmos) describes the period when the Moon is near the Sun (within ±15°), technically referring both to the period around New Moon and to a window around Full Moon. This is distinct from the usual conjunction (combustion), and is a broader period of influence.
