Codices Florentini

31. On mutual reception.

Mutual reception is when the diurnal planets occupy the places of the nocturnal, and the nocturnal the places of the diurnal, or when stars situated upon the signs are well dignified, while the lords of the signs are in debility and do not act.

32. On mutual lordship.

They are said to be mutual lords when, in the signs where the stars are, one has its exaltation and the other its domicile.

33. On domicile-lord.

A planet is called domicile-lord when it has multiple lordships in any of the signs; that is, of domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term, phase, or configuration.

34. On application.

Application is, properly, the most direct approach, when one star approaches another, the swifter to the slower, provided they are not separated by more than three degrees.

35. On lunar application.

Lunar application is the application of the Moon, when she is distant within a day's journey by synodic degree.

36. On mediation.

Mediation is when a star casts its rays to the mid-degrees of the application.

37. On separation.

Separation is when one of the stars separates either bodily or by aspect from the degree of the other star.

38. On conjunction.

Concerning “conjunction”: it is said that the Moon is carried when she comes to fifteen degrees from the Sun; and to release it is when, having separated from it, she recedes by the same number of degrees from the Sun; and the same is said concerning the Full Moon. For when she is within fifteen degrees before the Full Moon, she is coming to conjunction; but when she has moved that amount backward, she releases it.
