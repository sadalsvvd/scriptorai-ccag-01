APPENDIX

…of that intellect, in order that a great event might be made manifest in the world, either in the heavens or on the earth, such as an eclipse of the sun or moon, a flood, the appearance of a great prophet, the destruction of a nation, or the birth of a fortunate one—from which each occurs at long intervals and is made evident to mankind. And every race of men among those mentioned has established a beginning as a foundation and their first reckoning through it. Later, times according to the sun, and later, times according to the moon, and later still, astronomers set down the tables, the clocks, and the daily reckoning by which they operate, for this reason: that from the flood there are five epochs.

Chapter One.

The first year, which is called terikh among the Persians, is from Nebuchadnezzar; and the beginning of this year is from when he ascended to the throne. And the beginning of that year was day four. That day was the beginning of the month Thoth among the Egyptians, which is their first month. And the Egyptians retain these years. The month in that dialect is called thus *** as the Persians have it, of twenty-six days. And Ptolemy also set down the course of the stars in that book which is called Muzatēs for that year.

The second year is from Alexander the Macedonian, after the king of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar. In this year the aforesaid Egyptians reckon, and their chronology is according to the Persians. Thus, the beginning of the period from when he ascended to the throne is day one, which is the first of the month Thoth, after the year of Nebuchadnezzar. From that time until Alexander, two hundred and twenty-four years passed;¹ and in the 225th year, this is called the second year. And Ptolemy set down the course of the fixed stars for this year, and Thaunis the Alexandrian, in his computation, which is called the kanon, also set down the course of the stars for this year.

The third year is from the time of Alexander, son of Philip; he is called Dulkarnayn. In this year the Romans and Syrians reckon, and the Romans reckon by the years of this era.
