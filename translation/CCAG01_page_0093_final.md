APPENDIX

By means of that mind^1🤖, a great work was manifested to the world—either in heaven or on earth—such as an eclipse of the sun or the moon, or the flood, or the appearance of a great prophet, or the destruction of a nation, or the birth of someone fortunate; each of which happens over long periods and becomes evident to humankind. And every race of mankind that has been mentioned has set down a single beginning as a foundation and count their first years from it; later, they established [reckonings] by means of solar years, and later again by lunar years, and still later, the astronomers, by means of their own tables and horologia and daily ephemerides, through which they work, have determined that from the flood there are five other eras.

Chapter One.

The first era, which is called Terikh among the Persians, is reckoned from Nabuchodonosor; and the beginning of this era is from when he ascended to power. The commencement of that era was on the fourth day. That day was the beginning of the month Thoth among the Egyptians, their first month. The Cyptids^2🤖 (Copts) preserve the reckoning of these times. As for the name of the month in their dialect, it is [***] as the Persians retain, with [tek'h] days. Ptolemy also, in his book called Myzates^3🤖, established the course of the stars for that year.

The second era is from [the reign of] Alexander the Macedonian, after the king of Babylon and Nabuchodonosor; to this year the aforementioned Cyptids reckon, and their times are reckoned according to the Persians. Thus, the initiation of the period from when that one took power is on the first day, that which is the first of the month Thoth, following the year of Nabuchodonosor; from this time until Alexander, 224 years have passed; and in the 225th year this is the second era.^4🤖 And Ptolemy placed the course of the fixed stars in this year; and likewise, Thaunis the Alexandrian, in his edition called the Canon, placed the course of the stars in this era.

The third era is from the time of Alexander, the son of Philip; this one is called Dulkarnayn. In this year, the Romans and Syrians reckon, and the Romans preserve the reckoning of the years from this era.^5🤖

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase “by means of that mind” (or “intellect”) translates the genitive “νοῦ ἐκείνου,” preserving its ambiguity. Other possible renderings include “from that intelligence” or “of that intention.”
^2🤖 The word “Cyptids” (Κυπτίδες) refers to the Copts, i.e., Egyptian Christians; the form is rare, but context supports this reading.
^3🤖 “Myzates” (μυζατῆς) is rendered as a transliteration. Its identification is disputed; it likely refers to a technical or astronomical work of Ptolemy.
^4🤖 Some sources read “425th year” instead of “225th.” The original text should be consulted to confirm the correct numeral.
^5🤖 The phrase “and the Romans preserve the reckoning of the years from this era” could also be rendered more explicitly as “and the Romans reckon their chronology from this era,” emphasizing the adoption of this calendar system.
