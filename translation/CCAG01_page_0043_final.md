^3🤖 “Exemplarily” renders “ὑποδειγματικῶς,” which may also be translated “by way of example” or “illustratively,” depending on context.  
^4🤖 “The Serpent” translates “Ὀρφίδιον,” which may refer to the constellation Ophiuchus or have a more general astrological meaning.  
^5🤖 “Kokios” is a transliteration; the precise reference is uncertain.
