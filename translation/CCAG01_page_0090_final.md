¹ Book of Palchus: This is, without doubt, the same as that preserved in cod. 11, fol. 193 ff. Why he is called "interpreter" (ἐρμηνευτής)—a term which may also mean "translator," "expositor," or "commentator"^2🤖—I do not quite understand.

² Chamasus seems to be none other than Hamza of Isfahan (Hamza ben Alhasan Alisfahāni), who, around the year 961 CE, wrote his well-known history (Hamzae Ispahanensis annalium libri V, ed. Gottwaldt 1844 ff.). He was also skilled in astronomy, as an investigator of chronological systems (cf. Albirūnī, Chronology of Ancient Nations, ed. Sachau, 1879, p. 61 ff. et passim).

³ Isaac ben Solomon Israeli, philosopher and physician, died c. 950, was also very famous in the medieval West (cf. Steinschneider, Die hebräischen Uebersetz. des Mittelalters, vol. I, §223 ff. [p. 338] and §479 ff. [755 ff.]). Although he was not averse to mystical doctrines (Steinschneider, §297), he yet does not seem to have pursued astrology.

⁴ Which book of Hermes Trismegistus is designated thus is uncertain.

⁵ It may refer to a certain astrological book of the Sabaeans of Carrhae, translated into Hebrew; cf. Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier, vol. I, p. 715; vol. II, p. 464. The "Book of the Harranians" (*klāvā d’hārānāte*) was also known to the Syrians; cf. Payne-Smith, Lex. Syr. s.v., vol. I, p. 1376. Yet, the form Χαρανιωτ(ου?) seems to suggest something else.

⁶ There is no need to discuss Vettius Valens further here; cf. Riess in Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopädie, vol. II, col. 1822, above p. 79.

⁷ Cf. above, p. 81, n. 1.

^1🤖 The phrase "rolling books" (κυλιόμενα βιβλία) is rendered as "scrolls" for clarity, as it refers to books in the form of scrolls, as opposed to codices.

^2🤖 The Greek ἐρμηνευτής ("interpreter") can also mean "translator," "expositor," or "commentator," and the ambiguity is preserved in the note.
