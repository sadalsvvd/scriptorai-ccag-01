¹ καὶ omitted in A.  ² σολλ A : σολομῶντος V.  ³ iw A.  ⁴ ἐμπειρίας V.  ⁵ μου-  
σίου V. I thought of Moses—The rest are omitted in V.  ⁶ ταπεινώσεων] The compendium of the codex seems to read thus, although one would expect ταπεινωμάτων.  
¹³ ἀληθʼ or ἀχθθ᾽ in A. It is scarcely a proper name.  ¹⁵ Χαρανιωτ᾽ in A.  ἠβραῖοις in A.

¹ The book of Palchos: this is doubtless the same as that preserved in codex 11, fol. 193 ff. Why he is called “interpreter” I do not fully understand.

² Chamasus seems to be none other than Hamza of Isfahan (Hamza ben Al-Hasan Al-Isfahānī), who around the year 961 CE wrote the well-known history (Hamzae Ispahanensis annalium libri V, ed. Gottwaldt 1844ff.). For he was also versed in astronomy, as an investigator of chronological systems (cf. Al-Biruni, Chronology of Ancient Nations, ed. Sachau, 1879, p. 61ff. and passim).

³ Isaac ben Solomon Israeli, philosopher and physician, died around 950, was also very famous in the medieval West (cf. Steinschneider, Die hebräischen Uebersetzungen des Mittelalters, vol. I, § 223ff. [p. 338] and § 479ff. [755ff.]). Although he did not disdain mystical doctrines (Steinschneider, § 297), yet he does not seem to have pursued astrology.

⁴ Which book of Hermes Trismegistus is so designated is uncertain.

⁵ Perhaps it refers to a certain astrological book of the Sabaeans of Carrhae translated into Hebrew, cf. Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier, vol. I, p. 715, vol. II, p. 464. The Book of the Haranites (klāvā d’hārānāte) was also known to the Syrians, cf. Payne-Smith, Lexicon Syriacum, s.v., vol. I, p. 1376. However, the form Χαρανιωτ(ου?) seems to suggest something else.

⁶ Let us not say more here about Vettius Valens; cf. Riess in Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopädie, vol. II, col. 1822, above p. 79.

⁷ Cf. above, p. 81, n. 1.
