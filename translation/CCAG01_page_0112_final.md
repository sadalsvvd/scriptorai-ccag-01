…it will hide in the fields; if it is Taurus, it is in the city, near a butcher or a provision dealer; if Gemini, not far, but close to those places; if Cancer, it will remain in the very city itself and another person will bring it; if Leo, it is in deserted places; if Virgo, not far; if Libra, within the same boundaries; if Scorpio, outside the city in temples, not far; if Sagittarius, it will depart across the sea; if Capricorn, in remote sacred places to the west; if Aquarius, by rivers, not far; if Pisces, by sandy sea-shores. Also observe the stars in the subterranean place: if Saturn is in the subterranean place, bonds fall upon workers; if Mars, they are slain on a mountain; if Jupiter or Venus, they are declared free; if Mercury, they wander off sideways; if the Moon is on the ascendant, it will be found through accusations; if at the midheaven, in crowds or public places; if then toward the west, in dirty places; if in the subterranean place, it will be found with difficulty.

F. 125 (262v). 87. A necessary inception, during which I failed to find it while wandering, but later, having discovered the cause, I marveled at the outcome regarding the letters that were brought.

In the year of Diocletian 260, month Thoth 17th, day of Kronos, hour 1, certain painful letters were brought, containing all things contrary to the intention of the recipient. The inception was found as follows: ☉ in ♏ 10°, ☾ and ☋ in 4°, Ἥ ► in 56°, ♃ in 7°, 55°, ♂ ♃ in 8°, ♀ in ♌ 8°, ⚷ ♇ in 25°, Ascendant 𐅈 in 1°, Midheaven ♃ in 1°, Part of Fortune 𐅉 in 25°, ♐ 40, 2°, 24°.

I found Jupiter ruling by degree, and Venus positioned at the ascendant, and with the Moon and Jupiter and the Part of Fortune, possessing good fortune and being situated in the East, adding to the numbers, and making the Moon’s third house its tenth, and its dodecatemorion falling in Scorpio, and Jupiter, lord of the ascendant, also ruling perpendicularly at the ascendant. I said, therefore, because of these things, that the sending appeared to have a good configuration, though in fact it contained contrary matters; for upon examining the inception more exactly, I found Venus, the lord of the inception, had no relationship to the ascendant and the outcome.

4 = 5 September 488 CE.  
6–8 I have used the astrological signs, which the typographer had available, as an example to indicate the codex notation, where the words ὡροσκόπος (ascendant), μεσουράνημα (midheaven), etc., are given not in words but by symbols.
