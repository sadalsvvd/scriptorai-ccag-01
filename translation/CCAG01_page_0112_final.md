...it will be hidden in the fields; if Taurus, it is in the city, near a butcher or a provision seller; if Gemini, not far away, but near those places; if Cancer, it will remain in the very city, and another will bring it; if Leo, it is in deserted places; if Virgo, not far; if Libra, within the same boundaries; if Scorpio, outside the city, in sacred places not far; if Sagittarius, it will go off across the sea; if Capricorn, to remote sacred places toward the west; if Aquarius, by rivers—not far; if Pisces, by the seashore, near the sea. Also observe the stars [in the underground place]: if Saturn (Κρόνος) is in the underground, bonds^1🤖 befall laborers; if Mars (Ἄρης), slaughter occurs on the mountain; if Jupiter (Ζεύς) or Venus (Ἀφροδίτη), they are called free; if Mercury (Ἑρμῆς), they wander on oblique paths; if the Moon is ascending, it will be found through accusations; but if at the midheaven, among crowds or in public places; if then to the west, in filthy places^2🤖; but if underground, it will be found with difficulty.

F. 125 (262v). 87. The necessary inception at which I arrived, having wandered, and after that, having found the cause, I marveled at the operation concerning letters/documents/writings^3🤖 conveyed.

In the year of Diocletian 260, on the 17th of Thoth, day of Saturn, first hour, certain distressing letters/documents^3🤖 were brought, having all things contrary to the intention of the recipient. The inception was found thus: ☉ ♏ 10°, ☾ ☋ 4, Ἑρμῆς 26, ὡροσκόπος (Ascendant) 𐅉 7 55, ♂ ♃ 8, ♀ ♌ 8, ⚷ ♇ 25, Ascendant 𐅈 1, Midheaven (μεσουράνημα) ♃ 1, Lot of Fortune (κλήρος τύχης) 𐅉 25. Sagittarius 40, Moon 2 24.

I found Jupiter (Ζεύς) governing by degree, and that Venus (Ἀφροδίτη), near the Ascendant, and that the Moon, Jupiter, and Lot of Fortune were in the Good Daemon, and in the eastern direction, and favorable in the numerical reckonings, and advancing after the third day of the Moon, and its dodekatemorion falling in Scorpio, with Jupiter (lord of the Ascendant) governing by upright aspect. For these reasons, I said that the indications for the letters/documents^3🤖 were favorable in their conjunction, yet in truth they contained the opposite; for, upon later precise examination of the inception, I found that Venus, the ruler of the inception, had no relation to the Ascendant nor to the activation.

4 = 5 September 488 CE. 6–8 I have used the astrological symbols, which indeed the printer had at hand among the type, to give as an example the notation of the codex, where the words Ascendant, Midheaven likewise are not written as words but represented by symbols. 15 παρεῖχον cod., corr. m 1 in marg.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek "δεσμοῖς" is literally "bonds" or "fetters"; both are possible, but "bonds" is more general in English.
^2🤖 The text likely corresponds to "filthy places" if the Greek is "μιαρά"; if "hidden places," the Greek would be "ἀπόκρυφα"—this translation assumes the term supports "filthy."
^3🤖 The term τράμματα in Greek may mean "letters," "documents," or more generally "writings"; the translation retains all, as the original is ambiguous.
