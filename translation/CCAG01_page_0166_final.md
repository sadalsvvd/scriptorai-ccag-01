LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The technical term ὑπαυγοὶ ("under-the-rays") is standard in Hellenistic astrology for a planet or star that is obscured by the Sun’s proximity (usually within 15 degrees). The term "phases" (φάσεις) refers to the relative position with respect to the Sun.

^2🤖 For "communal relations," the Greek likely has συμβιώσεις, which can also be rendered as "cohabitations" or "associations." The phrase is kept broad to reflect the generality in Greek astrological usage.

^3🤖 "Daimon" (δαίμων) is the literal Greek, frequently translated as "Spirit" in later sources; both are noted here for completeness.
