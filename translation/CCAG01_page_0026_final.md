LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek phrase “τὰ δ’ κέντρα” (“the d’ points”) is ambiguous. "κέντρα" can mean “points,” “centers,” or “critical signs,” and in medical/astrological context may refer to technical figures or points; “δ’” may be a formulaic marker or the numeral four. The precise intent is unclear without the Greek context and might require technical cross-checking.

^2🤖 "Philokalia" (Greek φιλοκαλία) could refer to a collection or idea of “love of beauty” but is also a title of an influential spiritual anthology; the sense here is likely in reference to philosophical or medical beauty/virtue, not the later work.

^3 The opusculum (little work) is pseudonymous, composed around the year 775 CE; see Usener, Index Schol. Bonn. 1879, p. 9 ff. The same edited it in the scholia index for 1880.
