LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 “Inc.” (incipit) and “Des.” (desinit) mark the beginning and end words of the quoted work, as is standard in catalogues. “Cf. below, codex 16” translates “infra, cod. 16”; using “below, codex 16” is more accessible to English readers.
2. ^2🤖 Folio and manuscript conventions (f., cod., cf.) are preserved for scholarly precision. “i.e., thenceforth …” replaces “scil.” for clarity.
3. ^3🤖 “We possess the beginnings of all the centers” is a literal rendering of a technical astrological phrase from the source; cf. LLM notes for possible nuance.
4. ^4🤖 “Eighteen signs of the zodiac” is a literal rendering of the Greek, though traditionally there are twelve; the manuscript may refer to subdivisions or a variant scheme. The chapter number “thirty-eighth” appears in one of the compared translations and fits the Greek source text (ρη’ = 38). The translation “Seek the explanation of it” reflects the slightly irregular original wording, as indicated by <sic> in the manuscript.
