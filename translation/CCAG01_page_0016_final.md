LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 For “Chronocracy” (Greek: χρόνος + κρατέω, “rulership over time”), this technical term is standard in astrological literature. “Apportioning” renders ἐπιμερίζων, reflecting the technical process of assigning or governing periods. “Cause misfortunes” translates κακῶν ποιήσει, an idiom denoting the production of negative outcomes.

^2🤖 “Sharp and lofty” renders the Greek adjectives (ὀξὺ καὶ μετεώρων), typical in astrological descriptions of Hermes’ rulership. “Sharp” (ὀξὺ) can denote keenness or swiftness, while “lofty” (μετεώρων) refers to elevation or height, both metaphorical attributes described in the literature.

^3🤖 The phrase “on the double day (ἐν δισώμμῳ) regarding both” preserves the Greek term “δισώμμος,” whose precise meaning is debated. Interpretations include “a period of two days/months” or “concerning both (conjunction and full moon) together.” The transliteration is retained pending further scholarly consensus.
