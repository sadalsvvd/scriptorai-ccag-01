After the characters of Theophrastus, written in a most unsightly hand, the following astrological disputations are found:

Folio 12.	On solar and lunar portents, etc. — Lydus, On Omens, ch. 9.
Folio 16 verso.	On thunderbolts — Lydus, ibid., ch. 43–52 (p. 95 ff. Wachsmuth).

Folio 22.	The configurations of the parts of the sphere. [An epitome of the popular Chaldaean doctrine. Wachsmuth].^1🤖
Folio 00.	How we are able to find the zodiac sign and the degree in which the Sun is.

As an example, a certain day in the year 936 after Augustus Caesar is given.^2🤖 “This little work abounds in corrections and erasures, and appears to have been composed hastily and not without carelessness” (Bandini).

Folio 44 recto.	An astrological fragment begins: “In Taurus, a round-faced and fair [figure], because it is the house of Leo.”^3🤖 — Next: “it is then convex... who.”

Folio 241 verso.	On portents (On the 19th and 23rd of March, etc. On such days—to be moved [or to take action] on such days).^4🤖
Folio 242.	On the days of the Moon (“On the first day of the Moon, Adam was formed—the thirtieth day of the Moon, the prophet Samuel was born—the sick person recovers swiftly”). Ends on folio 245.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Popular Chaldaean doctrine”: The Latin “vulgaris” is best rendered as “popular” rather than “common” or “vulgar,” reflecting standard scholarly usage for mainstream, non-technical versions of ancient doctrines.
^2🤖 “Year 936 after Augustus Caesar”: This refers to a dating system that calculates years from the start of Augustus Caesar’s reign; the exact correspondence to the modern calendar requires specialized reckoning.
^3🤖 The Greek is elliptical: “In Taurus, a round-faced and fair [figure], because it is the house of Leo.” The subject (e.g., “figure,” “astrological type”) is not explicitly stated in the original. For “fair,” the Greek “λευκόν” can mean “white” or “fair” in the sense of complexion.
^4🤖 The phrase captures a recurrent formula in such tables; “to be moved” or “to take action” equals “to stir oneself” on such days, per the original manuscript’s idiom.

Additional manuscript terminology:
— “Octavo” (in-8º): refers to the format/size of the manuscript volume, not its content.
— “Folio,” “recto,” “verso”: refer to the leaf and sides of the manuscript. “Folio 16 verso” = the back side of folio/leaf 16; “folio 19 recto” = the front side of folio/leaf 19.
