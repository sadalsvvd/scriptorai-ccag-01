After the Characters of Theophrastus, there are found, written in a most execrable hand, the following astrological treatises:

Folio 12.	On Solar and Lunar Omens, etc. — Lydus, On Omens, chapter 9.  
Folio 16v.	On Lightnings — Lydus, ibid., chapters 43–52 (p. 95 ff. Wachsmuth).  
Folio 19r.	On Earthquakes — Lydus, ibid., chapters 53–58 (p. 107 ff.).  
Folio 22.	Figures of the Parts of the Sphere. [Epitome of the Chaldaean common doctrine. Wachsmuth.]  
Folio 00.	How we are able to find the Sign and Degree in which the Sun is.

In it, by way of example, a certain day in the year 936 after Augustus Caesar is given. “Such a little work teems with many corrections and erasures, and it appears to have been dashed off hastily and not without carelessness” (Bandini).

Folio 44r.	An astrological fragment begins: In Taurus, [the face is] round and white because it is the house of Leo. — Elsewhere: it is then curved throughout... who.

Folio 241v.	On Indications (In the month of March, the 19th and 23rd etc. On such-and-such days — to move on such-and-such days).  
Folio 242.	On the Days of the Moon (“First day of the Moon: Adam was formed — thirtieth day of the Moon: Samuel the prophet was born — the sick man recovers quickly”). Ends at folio 245.
