LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 On "The Moon being in Aries—accompanies the Sun or is in opposition": The Greek phrase summarized here indicates the astrological condition relevant to the teaching of the arts. The wording "accompanies the Sun or is in opposition" translates συνοδεύει τῷ Ἡλίῳ ἢ διαμετρεί (“is in conjunction with the Sun or in opposition [to it]”). This preserves the technical astrological nuance; a more literal rendering would be “is with the Sun or diametrically opposed.”  
^2🤖 The phrase in parentheses is fragmentary in the Greek; "for the stronger ones in spring" is supplied for clarity and may be interpretive.  
^3🤖 "Will be saved by the horoscope" translates a phrase referencing salvation via the horoscope (the rising sign); some sources use "ascendant" in this context. "Bedridden" is from the literal Greek "having reclined."
