APPENDIX 143

Rather than the two luminaries, the house of Ares, Aries, was preferred. Thus we say that, since the ancients fashioned the twelve zodiacal signs corporeally according to the parts of the human body, making the beginning from Aries on the claim that it is the head, Taurus the neck, and so on sequentially down to the feet, for this reason—from the most ruling member,^1🤖 which signifies the brain and all things pertaining to the head—they made the beginning from Aries. Furthermore, they also reckoned the ages in relation to the turning points, taking the beginning from the spring sign, that is, from Aries. For spring signifies infancy, summer youth, autumn middle age, and winter old age. There are also the signs, which are called tropical, fixed, and double-bodied.^2🤖

They are called tropical inasmuch as, when the Sun is in these signs, the turnings^3🤖 of the seasons are altered. For instance, when it is in Aries, a tropical sign, it brings about the spring and equinoctial turning, and from that point the air becomes more temperate and the day lengthens beyond the equal hours. But when it is in Taurus, a fixed and spring sign, it renders the air steadier and unchangeable, and the day increases further. When it is in Gemini, a double-bodied sign, it makes the air variable and causes the transition between spring and summer, and the day increases further. Thus, in this triad of signs, spring—which is air—is completed.

Again, when the Sun is in Cancer, a tropical sign, it brings about the summer turning, and the air begins to grow warmer, and from then on it subtracts from the length of the day and adds to the length of the night. Again, when it is in Leo, a fixed and summer sign, it renders the air even steadier and unchangeable, subtracting from the length of the day and adding to that of the night. Again, when it is in Virgo, a double-bodied sign, it makes the air variable and causes the transition between summer and autumn, and the night increases further while the day diminishes.

In this triad of signs, sum-

^1🤖 The phrase "most ruling member" translates the Greek τοῦ ἡγεμονικωτέρου, referring to the head as the commanding part of the body. Alternatives include "most dominant member" or "most governing part."  
^2🤖 “Tropical, fixed, and double-bodied” render the Greek τροπικά, στερεά, διοίσυμα. "Fixed" is standard over "solid." "Double-bodied" is a literal translation; in modern astrology, these are also called "mutable," "dual," or "bicorporeal" signs.  
^3🤖 "Turnings"—Greek τροπαί—refers to the solstitial and equinoctial points: the cardinal pivots of the seasons. Alternatives: "turning-points," "cardinal points."
