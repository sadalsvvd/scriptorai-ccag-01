APPENDIX 143

…rather than the two luminaries, the house of Ares, Aries, was preferred; we say, therefore, that since the ancients assigned the twelve signs of the Zodiac to correspond physically to the members of the human body, making the beginning from Aries, declaring it to be the head, Taurus the neck, and so forth in order down to the feet, for this reason, from the most commanding member—which signifies the brain and all that pertains to the head—they made the beginning from Aries. Furthermore, they also ordered the ages according to the seasons, taking the beginning from the vernal sign, that is, from Aries; for spring signifies infancy, summer youth, autumn middle age, and winter old age. Thus there are also signs which are called tropical, fixed, and double-bodied.

Signs are called tropical because, when the Sun is in these signs, the changes of the seasons occur; for example, when the Sun is in Aries, a tropical sign, it brings about the spring and vernal equinox, and from then on the air becomes more temperate and clear, and the day lengthens beyond the equal hours; when it is in Taurus, a fixed and vernal sign, it makes the air steadier and more unchanging, and the day increases still more; when it is in Gemini, a double-bodied sign, the air becomes more variable and forms an intermediate composition between spring and summer, and the day increases yet further. In this trigon of signs, therefore, the period of spring—associated with air—is completed. Again, when the Sun is in Cancer, a tropical sign, it brings about the summer turning, and the air begins to become warmer, and from then it subtracts from the length of the day and adds to the length of the night; again, when it is in Leo, a fixed and summer sign, it makes the air even steadier and more unchanging, subtracting from the length of the day and adding to the length of the night; again, when it is in Virgo, a double-bodied sign, the air becomes more variable and its composition is intermediate between summer and autumn, and at this point the night increases further and the day decreases.

In this trigon of signs, sum-
