clearly manifest parents and well-disposed friends as well;  
Zeus, the great heavenly giver of wealth and fruits;  
and at the furthest end, to the most excellent, he bestows inexhaustible wealth, and out of the broad-soiled earth, precious gold in abundance, to unite them all;  
and at the boundary of fate, he gives as heirs both those of one’s own kin and those who have come from outside.

Ares in the place of parents.  
If Ares inclines and drives swiftly into the course of generations,  
he sends early deaths, dreadful diseases, parent-scarcity, wounds of iron and grievous calamities.  
Much pain by blood and hateful diseases—jaundice, baleful pallor—falls upon the wretched body,  
and in life, labors that cause utter disgraceful pain.

Aphrodite in the place of parents.  
She whom they call “the light-bringer,” laughter-loving Aphrodite,  
celestial star, singular in great vigor, both a blessing to parent and to friend, and calm,  
but with respect to wives she is worse, a renowned but distress-bringing star,  
making them conspicuous in the community, bestowing repute and at times exile, as well as dread afflictions,  
corrupting prudent wives in their beds.

Hermes in the place of parents.  
Hermes occupying the place of parents is not evil;  
by the arts of boldness and wisdom he brings about skillful works;  
he renders one distinguished in opinions and skilled achievements  
in the shining arts of the Muses, adorned with inventions.

Selene in the place of children.  
If you behold golden Selene again over offspring—loving children—guiding the path of friends,  
she bestows a blessed home, grants the parent children of supremely beautiful character,  
granting much happiness over time, and especially, among those well-born, the possession of a precious and increasing number in life.
