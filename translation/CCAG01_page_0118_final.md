clearly-shown parents and well-disposed friends as well;  
heavenly Zeus, the great giver of wealth and fruits;  
† and at the farthest boundary, upon those who are by far the most blessed,  
he grants unwearying wealth in abundance, and from the broad-bosomed earth  
he bestows gold exceedingly precious, heaped together;  
and bestowing honors, Zeus the good grants many profits at the boundary set by fate  
to the heirs of their own and to those who have advanced to what is another’s.

Ares in the place of parents.  
But if Ares consents and swiftly urges on,  
he sends swift-doomed children by dreadful diseases and makes progeny rare,  
and by wounds of iron and dreadful calamities,  
he brings manifold pains with blood and hateful diseases,  
to a wretched body he gives jaundice and pallor,  
and in life, grievous toils bringing every kind of disgraceful pain.

Aphrodite in the place of parents.  
They call her Phosphorus—laughter-loving Aphrodite,  
a heavenly star, outstanding in great strength,  
kind both to parent and well-disposed friend, but toward wives  
she is inferior, a renowned star of much pain;  
among the people she reveals both distinction and fame for them,  
she brings estrangement and the “albios”^1🤖 that follows upon it;  
to the prudent she brings dread things, corrupting wives in their beds.

Hermes in the place of parents.  
Hermes, traversing the place of parents, is not evil;  
with courage and wise skills he weaves intricate works,  
he adorns one inferior in repute and skill with knowledge,  
in the bright arts of the Muses, rich in invention.

Selene in the place of children.  
But if you observe golden Selene again  
at the birth of children, guiding the course for beloved offspring,  
she grants a prosperous house and preserves the parent  
among children possessing very beautiful adornment;  
she grants much happiness in time—especially with well-born children—  
and to possess the highly-prized, ever-increasing number for the span of life.

1. “albios”: The Greek term “ἀλβίον” is obscure and debated; it may refer to a physical affliction (e.g., a whiteness or disease), social estrangement, or another negative condition. The word is retained here given scholarly uncertainty.
