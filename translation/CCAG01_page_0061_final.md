LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The original Greek includes a marginal note (λ. αἴνη), indicating a possible alternate reading: "praise" rather than "good fortune of exile." The phrase "ἀγαθοῦ πότε συμβῇναι" could mean "when something good (such as praise) happens," or, depending on context, "when the good fortune of exile occurs." The ambiguity is preserved here for scholarly accuracy.

^2🤖 The Greek word (ὑπουργῶν) can mean "subordinate" or "assistant," but the parenthetical note (λ. -οῦ?) suggests textual uncertainty or an alternate reading. It could also mean "magistrate" if another textual form is read. The ambiguity is retained here.

^3🤖 The Greek verb is likely "τραπῇ," which literally means "turned" or "changed." The intended nuance could be that the report "has greatly changed" or "was strongly diverted." The ambiguity is noted.

^4🤖 "He departs by the tropic" (τροπικὸν ἀπαίρῃ) may refer to movement according to the astrological "tropic" signs, or could signify going by a turning or change. The term is left literal; for full interpretation, further philological analysis of astrological practice would be beneficial.

^5🤖 "Ascendant" translates Greek "ὡροσκόπος." In ancient astrology, the "ascendant" indicates the rising sign or horoscope, and can refer to the chart of a specific time. Both "ascendant" and "horoscope" are used in secondary literature.
