...he will depart sufficiently illuminated and will be quickly apprehended. If Helios and Hermes are observing, he will be detained for eleven days, being remembered by those who saw him. If Kronos is at the midheaven or at the subterranean angle or at the superior angle, the thief will be caught in the act. Nevertheless, these will always have bodies that are worn out under subjection and will be remembered by women. If, however, Aphrodite is already in aspect with the Moon or passing through the midheaven, a free woman accompanying him will bear witness to the flight. If Ares happens to be in the same places, he will act likewise. Kronos moreover will extraordinarily receive scars and blows and wounds, on the face and on the legs. If quadrupedal signs are rising or culminating, or if the shadow of the Moon or of any of the five stars aspects, he will be found in a cavern. If an observation is made, he is betrayed by a neighbor or by someone present. But if Aphrodite or Zeus or Helios is involved, a relative, or a son or father or brother will join the search and will free him. And if Zeus is in Aries or Taurus or Gemini or Cancer or Leo or Virgo or Scorpio or Pisces, the fugitive will be found in sacred places, and especially if Aphrodite is observing, those captured in sacred places will be handed over. If Kronos is with the Moon, he will be caught in a pure place; if Kronos and Zeus are with the Moon, he will be found in a pure place. If Kronos is culminating, he will be handed over to prison and bonds after eighty-nine or one hundred days. If Zeus is at the ascendant or midheaven or with the Moon, he will carry off not a little silver with him, and will betray someone else and will be apprehended within eighty-nine or one hundred days; and through these the master will obtain some benefit. The same applies for Aphrodite. Moreover, say he is a "sister," †boy-lover, given-to-licking, unyielding†.* If Hermes is present, describe the fugitive as malicious, cunning, lying in ambush; if Hermes is with the Moon at the midheaven, it only shows that he has withdrawn; if Hermes is at the ascendant or midheaven with Aphrodite, a man and a woman together are the culprits; if with Kronos at the ascendant or midheaven, two are the culprits. With Aphrodite, say the culprit is younger, from 40 to 50 years. If with Ares at the ascendant or midheaven, a masculine woman, and they are the culprits. If Kronos, Hermes, and the Moon are at the ascendant or midheaven, say the fugitive is a eunuch. If Ares, Hermes, and Helios are at the midheaven or ascendant, say the fugitive is a hermaphrodite. If Kronos and Ares are at the ascendant, the fugitive hands himself over for the sacrilege of another.

Whatever may be lacking, judge from the ascendant, since in ...
