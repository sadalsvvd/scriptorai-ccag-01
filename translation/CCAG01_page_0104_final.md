Being sufficiently illuminated, he will escape but will soon be apprehended; but while Helios and Hermes are in aspect, he will be detained until the eleventh day, having been recognized by those who saw him. When Kronos is at the culmination, the subterranean angle (lower culmination), or the superior angle (Midheaven), the thief will be caught in the act; however, these persons will always have bodies that have been marred under subjugation and will be remembered by women. But if Aphrodite is already ray-cast with Selene or passes through the culmination, a free woman who accompanies him remembers the flight; if Ares happens to be in the same places, he will do these things as well. And as for Kronos, in addition, he will receive scars and blows and wounds on the face and on the legs. If quadrupedal signs rise or culminate, or if the shadow of Selene leaves any of the five stars, he will be found in that place; but if he comes under observation, he is betrayed by a neighbor or one of those present. If it is Aphrodite or Zeus or Helios, a blood relation ‚Äî or son or father or brother ‚Äî will help and free him. If Zeus is either in Aries or Taurus or Gemini or Cancer or Leo or Virgo or Scorpio or Pisces, the fugitive will be found in sacred places, and especially if Aphrodite observes, those detained in sacred places will be handed over. If Kronos is with Selene, he will be captured in a pure place; if Kronos and Zeus are with Selene, he will be found in a pure place. When Kronos culminates, he will be handed over to prison and chains after 89 or 100 days.^1ü§ñ If Zeus is on the Ascendant or the Midheaven or with Selene, he will carry off with himself a considerable amount of silver, will betray someone else, and will be detained within 89 or 100 days; and their master will, through them, have some gain. Aphrodite does the same. Moreover, call him a sister, bymenokoiton (?), katalichgion, arraton.^2ü§ñ If Hermes is present, call the fugitive malicious, cunning, lurking; if Hermes is with Selene on the Midheaven, it merely indicates that he has withdrawn himself. If Hermes is on the Ascendant or Midheaven with Aphrodite, a man together with a certain woman will act together; if with Kronos on the Ascendant or Midheaven, two will act together. Aphrodite: say ‚Äúyouth,‚Äù from 40 to 50 years old; if she is with Ares on the Ascendant or Midheaven, [then it is] a masculine woman, and they act together. Kronos, Hermes, and Selene on the Ascendant or Midheaven: call the fugitive a eunuch. Ares, Hermes, and Helios on the Midheaven or Ascendant: call the fugitive a hermaphrodite. If Kronos and Ares are on the Ascendant, the fugitive gives himself up for sacrilege in another‚Äôs sacred precinct.

But as for anything that, whether completed, [judge it] from the Ascendant, since among...

1. ^1ü§ñ The phrase "after 89 or 100 days" reflects the Greek numerals œÄŒ∏‚Äô (89) and œÅ‚Äô (100), which are sometimes given as a range to indicate uncertainty or variation in manuscript readings.
2. ^2ü§ñ The terms bymenokoiton, katalichgion, and arraton are transliterated from the Greek; their meanings are uncertain, likely referring to technical, slang, or social terms whose exact sense is debated in the scholarly literature.
