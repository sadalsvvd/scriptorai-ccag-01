^1🤖 The Greek phrase “τῶν μεγάλων δεκαμορίων” refers to the thirty-degree divisions of the zodiac—decans or “decamerisms”; the phrase “αἱ πλ’” is textually unclear, possibly meaning “in total thirty” or reflecting a scribal corruption.  
^2🤖 “Included in the outcomes” may refer to the incorporation of these bright stars in the casting of nativities or astrological outcomes; the phrase is ambiguous in the Greek.  
^3🤖 “John the Grammarian of Alexandria” is identified as John Philoponus, also known as John of Alexandria. His treatise on the use of the astrolabe was published from Paris manuscripts by Hase, Rheinisches Museum, VI, 1839, p. 129ff. Cf. Tannery, Revue de Philologie, 1888, p. 60ff.  
^4🤖 “The Silversmith” translates τοῦ ἀργύρου, which may play on the word for “silver” or “silversmith”; connection to Isaac as a monk is attested elsewhere, but the epithet here is marked as uncertain or deleted in the manuscript. Cf. Krumbacher, Byzantinische Literaturgeschichte, 2nd ed., p. 623.
