LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek phrase “ὁμοίως ἀρρενικὰ ἢ μεμι<τ>μένα” is likely corrupt; “μεμι<τ>μένα” is probably a scribal error for “μεμιγμένα” (“mixed”), referring to children who are either masculine or mixed (of both natures or ambiguous), per standard astrological terminology.

^2🤖 “Times of release” translates Greek “χρόνων ἀφέσεως.” In technical astrology, this may be rendered “periods of aphetai” (times ruled by releasing), referring to the aphetic system of time lords.

^3🤖 Greek “ἀπώλειαν προσώπου” may also be read as “loss of face” or “loss of appearance.” “Form” is chosen to reflect both physical and figurative meanings in astrological discourse.
