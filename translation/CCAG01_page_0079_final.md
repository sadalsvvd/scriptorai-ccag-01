LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase “the five stars” renders the Greek “οἱ ἐ΄ ἀστέρες,” in which “ἐ΄” is the Greek numeral for 5; it could potentially refer to the five classical planets.

^2🤖 The word “treasure” translates the Greek “θύσαυρος” (likely a misspelling for “θησαυρός”), meaning “treasure” or “treasury,” though “object” or “thing” is a possible alternate.

^3🤖 The phrase “three years” (ἐτῶν Γ΄) likely refers to an age or period but the precise meaning is uncertain in this context.

^4🤖 “By means of intercessions” (“διὰ πρεσβειῶν”) could refer to prayers or mediating influences, perhaps with astrological significance.
