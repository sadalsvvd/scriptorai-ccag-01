...having a signification for the inception, they unwaveringly bring about what is harmful, especially when the disease is of a Saturnine or Martian character. But one must be attentive lest Mars, by producing a discharge of blood, might provide a cure; for this often happens whenever he is testified as possessing a beneficent power by Jupiter or Venus.

Moreover, on the same matters, one should take counsel both from the medico-mathematical works of Hermes and Petosiris and from the writings of Protagoras; and these authorities likewise say: one must consider the moments of inception concerning crisis intervals based on both the Moon and her configurations with the stars and the Sun; and it is most necessary to give attention in such beginnings, that even if there is an eclipse or if those concerning expulsion are unknown, at any rate, through the timely and passing movements and configurations of the stars, one may make accurate prognostications.

We will therefore observe the principal phases of the Moon: these are conjunction, first quarter, full moon, last quarter, and, in addition, the syzygies. We will attend to her numbers both of longitude and latitude, and whether she subtracts from or adds to these values; and we must also observe the ruler of the phase, lest he dominate or oppose her, for he brings about changes and variegated diseases. One must also be on guard against the squares between the luminaries or also of the syzygies; for their influence is strong, and the crises arising from them are precarious. The harmonious configurations, those that are trine and hexagon, are less dangerous. The associations of the rays bring about, with Saturn, chills and numbness and rheumatism and shivering and increases of phlegm; with Jupiter, the onset of disease comes from plethora, or from the liver, or the joints, or the feet; if Mars observes the Moon, it is from bile, or fever, or causes relating to quadrupeds, or from wounds; if Venus, from the lungs, or spleen, or sleeplessness, or drunkenness; if Mercury, he brings about pains from bile, or dysentery, or earache, or uvula, or teeth, or tonsils. The Sun is the cause of heart disease; and sometimes he brings on the beginnings of illness from avoidance of bathing or from heat exhaustion.

The supplementary remedies that are applied harmonize according to the nature of the zodiacal sign in which the Moon is found at the time of the crisis: by phlebotomies in Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; by purgation and vomiting in Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces; by diuretics and cucurbit devices in Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius; phlebotomy should be used in Aries, Taurus, and Sagittarius; walking in...
