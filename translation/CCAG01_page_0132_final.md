...holding sway with regard to the inception, Saturn and Mars without exception bring about harm, especially when the illness is Saturnine or Martian in nature. However, care must be taken not to assume that Mars necessarily brings salvation through bloodletting; for this often occurs only when Mars, being endowed with beneficent power, is confirmed by the testimony of Jupiter or Venus.

Furthermore, one should consult these same matters both from the iatromathematical works of Hermes and Petosiris and from the treatises of Protagoras; for they also say that the times for the onset of crises should be taken from both the Moon and her relationship with the stars and the Sun. Special attention should be paid in such beginnings so that, even if there is a lack of the necessary knowledge or the circumstances of the outbreak are unknown, nevertheless, by means of the current movements and configurations of the stars at that time, prognosis may accurately proceed.

We shall therefore observe the principal phases of the Moon; these are: conjunction, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter, and, furthermore, the intervening conjunctions. We shall also pay attention to her numbers, that is, of longitude and latitude, and whether she is diminishing or increasing these numbers. One should also observe the ruler of the phase, to determine whether or not he happens to be dominating or in opposition, for in such cases the diseases become subject to changes and take on varied forms. One must also beware of the squares between the luminaries or even their conjunctions, for their influence is powerful and the crisis arising from them is perilous; safer, however, are those harmonious aspects, namely the trines and sextiles^1ü§ñ. The interactions of their rays produce, in connection with Saturn, chills, loss of heat, fluxes, shivering, and increases of phlegm; in connection with Jupiter, the onset of illness from plethora or from the liver, joints, or feet; if Mars aspects the Moon, the causes are to be sought in bile, fever, quadrupeds, or wounds; if Venus, then from the lungs, spleen, insomnia, or drunkenness; if Mercury, ailments from bile, dysentery, earache, tonsils, teeth, or the throat; and the Sun is the cause of cardiac disease. There are also times when the cause of the sickness arises from deprivation of bathing or from heat.

The auxiliary effects that follow correspond to the nature of the zodiacal signs in which the Moon is found at the crisis: in Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, phlegm-expelling measures; in Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, purgation and emetics; in Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius, diuretics and cucurbits^2ü§ñ; one should use bloodletting in Aries, Taurus, and Sagittarius, walking in...

1. ^1ü§ñ The term "sextiles" translates the Greek "hexagon", a standard 60¬∞ astrological aspect. The literal term is "hexagon", but "sextile" is customary in scholarly English.
2. ^2ü§ñ "Cucurbits" renders the Greek œÉŒπŒ∫œçœÇ, which in medical context refers not to gourds but to suction cups used for therapeutic cupping. Some translate this as "cupping vessels."
