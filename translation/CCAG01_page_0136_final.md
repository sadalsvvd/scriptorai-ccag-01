...of the year (f. 59r) they claimed was the result. And these things, then, are not according to any natural institution nor do they possess a probable example, but rather, since the rising of the Nile takes place at that time throughout the land of the Egyptians and floods Egypt, for this reason they adopted this as the beginning of the year, though it does not correspond to the rest of the countries of our inhabited world. Later authors, as though with more precise natural knowledge and having adopted it by a more refined theory—namely, the mathematicians among the Greeks, I mean—have determined the new moon as the beginning of the year, when the Sun enters the beginning of Aries, having considered the horoscope-sign and the seasons of the wandering stars, along with those of the fixed stars and the centers as these are established at the time of nativity, and in this way have foretold the result of the year. But the most learned Ptolemy has used a more detailed method for such prediction, employing the four turning-points of the year—I mean, those conjunctions and full moons preceding the solstices and equinoxes, as well as their rulers together with the establishment of the centers and the influence of the co-rising fixed stars.

Now the lovers of the entire wisdom of the Persians, having translated the Greek books into their own tongue, used only the annual canon, that is, the rule based on the revolution of the Sun to the beginning of Aries, just as Critodemus and Valens and Dorotheus and Timarchus and their circle. Hence, dearest lover of learning, it is necessary—I would say, indeed, admirable—to adopt this tradition, which even the men of the East have set in place; namely, the annual nativity, that is, when the Sun enters the first minute of the first degree of Aries at the capital city, wherever that may be. But in the case of the capital city of the Saracens, where I have taken my observations, which lies further east than Babylon and, as you may have ascertained, by fifteen hours (that is, twenty-nine), and is called in Greek Irenopolis, and in the Syriac tongue Bardad; its latitude from the equator, deviating towards the northern regions, is thirty-three degrees. Since I have found the sages of the East practicing this annual revolution for...
