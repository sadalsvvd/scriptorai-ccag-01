...of the year (f. 59r), they claimed, was the result. These things, then, are not according to any natural ordinance or possessing a plausible example, but inasmuch as the inundation of the Nile comes about in those parts of Egypt at that time and turns Egypt into a sea, for this reason they used this event as the beginning of the year. However, this does not correspond to the other regions of our inhabited world. But those of later times, who considered themselves to possess a more precise knowledge of nature and who adopted this through a more exact theory—that is, I mean the Greek mathematicians—have defined the new moon as the beginning of the year, namely, when the Sun arrives at the beginning of Aries, having taken into consideration the ascendant sign and the periods of the planetary stars, along with those of the fixed stars and the placement of the centers, as is established at birth; and so they have indicated the outcome of the year in this fashion. The most wise Ptolemy, however, has employed a more refined method for such prediction, making use of the four cardinal points of the year, that is to say, the joint occurrences of the solstices and equinoxes with the conjunctions and full moons just preceding each, and with their respective rulers together with the placement of the centers and the power of the co-rising fixed stars.

Now, those who, in accordance with the entire wisdom of the Persians, translated the Greek books into their own language, used only the annual canon, that is, the period when the Sun enters the beginning of Aries—just as Critodemus and Valens and Dorotheus and Timócharis and their associates did. Hence, most studious reader, it is necessary—nay, it is rather honorable—to employ this tradition too, which also the easterners have established, namely, the annual nativity, that is, when the Sun, at the first minute of the first degree of Aries, enters, according to the capital city wherever it may be; and as to those following the capital city of the Saracens, where I have derived my calculations, which is east of Babylon and of Alexandria, as will be found to be 23 hours, 15 minutes; that is, 29 degrees. This city is called Irenopolis, but in the Syrian tongue, Bardad; and its latitude, measured from the equator according to its deviation toward the northern parts, is 33 degrees. Now, since I have found that the wise men of the East pursue this sort of annual revolution with respect to...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "ἀποτέλεσμα ἔφασκον γεγενῆσθαι" ("they claimed was the result") is translated impersonally to preserve the passive and indirect nature of the Greek syntax, where no subject is present.

^2🤖 The word "φυσικὸν τι θέτισμα" is rendered as "natural ordinance," acknowledging that "θέτισμα" could mean "institution," "ordinance," or "law." Alternate translations could include "instituted practice" or "appointment."

^3🤖 "ἡ τοῦ Νείλου ἀνάβασις" is translated as "the inundation of the Nile," which is the standard scholarly expression; literal translation would be "the rising of the Nile."

^4🤖 The phrase "τὴν νεομηνίαν τοῦ ἔτους τεθεσπίκασιν" ("have defined the new moon as the beginning of the year") is interpreted according to established translation usage; depending on astrological context, it could also be "have ordained the new moon at the year's commencement."

^5🤖 "ὁ Ἥλιος εἰς τὴν ἀρχὴν τοῦ Κριοῦ παραγένηται" is translated as "the Sun arrives at the beginning of Aries." Given the historical context, this refers to the vernal equinox.

^6🤖 The phrase "συνόδοις τε καὶ πανσελήνοις" refers to "conjunctions and full moons." Depending on context, "σύνοδος" can mean 'meeting,' but in technical astronomical literature, "conjunction" is conventional.

^7🤖 The distinctions among the capital cities (Roman/Byzantine, Saracenic, i.e., Arab, etc.) are rendered with reference to historical geography. The translation tries to clarify that "the capital city of the Saracens" refers to the seat of power at the time of writing.

^8🤖 Greek numerals are converted to their decimal equivalent: σγʹ = 23, ιεʹ = 15, ιτλʹ = 29, λγʹ = 33.

^9🤖 The city "Εἰρηνόπολις" ("Irenopolis") and its Syrian name "Βαρδαδά" ("Bardad") are preserved in Latin characters to respect the transliteration conventions; "Bardad" refers, most likely, to Baghdad. Some alternate transcriptions (e.g., "Barda'a") may be found depending on manuscript tradition.

^10🤖 For "τὴν τοιαύτην ἐνιαύσιον τροπὴν" ("this sort of annual revolution"), "τροπή" usually refers to "turning" or "revolution," in an astronomical sense, indicating a solar year. Alternate renderings could be "transit" or "return."
