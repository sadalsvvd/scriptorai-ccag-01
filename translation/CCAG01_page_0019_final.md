LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ðŸ¤– "Anthropomorphic signs" refers to zodiacal signs depicted as human or partly human figures (e.g., Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, etc.).

^2ðŸ¤– "With one educated in HermÄ“s" denotes a person versed in Hermetic or astrological knowledge, not literally the god Hermes.

^3ðŸ¤– "Are subject to the failure of the request" renders the original sense that such requests, made under these circumstances, are likely to fail.

^4ðŸ¤– "Messengers" is supplied based on context; ancient correspondence often depended on personal envoys as much as letters themselves.
