...of Aphrodite both the triplicity and the bounds, and Kronos both the exaltation and the bounds, yet the lordship of Aphrodite is greater on account of the domicile; in Scorpio, Mars has the domicile, as well as the triplicity and the bounds, Aphrodite the triplicity and the bounds, and the Moon only the triplicity, so that Mars is more dominant, both because of the domicile and because of the greater share according to the doctrines; in Sagittarius, Zeus has the domicile, and also the triplicity and the bounds, while the Sun only the triplicity, and the rest only the bounds, so Zeus is more dominant; in Capricorn, Kronos has the domicile and the bounds, the Moon the triplicity, Aphrodite the triplicity and the bounds, and Kronos is more dominant; in Aquarius, Kronos has the domicile, and both the triplicity and the bounds, while Hermes has both the triplicity and the bounds, and it is clear that Kronos is more dominant; in Pisces, Zeus has the domicile and the bounds, Mars and Aphrodite both the triplicity and the bounds, and the Moon the triplicity, so Zeus, therefore, is more dominant. For greater clarity, let these be set out thus: only the Sun for Leo, only the Moon for Cancer, Hermes for Gemini and Virgo, Aphrodite for Libra and Taurus, Mars for Aries and Scorpio, <Zeus for Sagittarius> and Pisces, <Kronos for Aquarius> and Capricorn.

31. On conjunction (also called application) and separation.

Conjunction, which is also called application, is when two stars—or more—are in one zodiacal sign and the preceding is joined to the following either bodily or by any figure, or is about to be joined within three degrees, except for the Moon, which forms a conjunction from ten degrees. Separation is when a star, having already been bodily joined or configured with another, withdraws again from it after three degrees, moving to the next; for the Moon alone, separation occurs after ten degrees.

32. On enclosure; stated in three ways.

Enclosure occurs when the body of a star in a certain sign, and the two signs on either side, are figured by one of the malefics, either by trine or by opposition; for example, let the Moon be in Virgo and Mars in Aries: here Mars figures the two signs on either side of Virgo, Leo and Libra, one by trine and the other by opposition. Therefore, when at a nativity the Moon or the Ascendant is enclosed by one of the malefics, the configuration is bad and makes those born short-lived. Others, however, have handed down enclosure as follows—
