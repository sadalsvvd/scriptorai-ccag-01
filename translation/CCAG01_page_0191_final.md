LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ðŸ¤– The expression "sun departing from the Moon" (á¼¥Î»Î¹Î¿Ï‚ á¼€Ï€Î¿ÏƒÎµÎ»Î·Î½Î¹Î¶ÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚) is an astrological technical term, indicating the Sun separated from the Moon, either in calculation or planetary relationship. Alternate translations might be "sun removed from the Moon" or "sun no longer under the Moon's influence." The choice to render this directly makes the underlying Greek more immediately accessible to the reader while preserving its technical connotation.
