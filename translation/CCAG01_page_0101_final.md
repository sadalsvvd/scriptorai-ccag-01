CODICES FLORENTINI — APPENDIX

Say that the lost object is present. If the Sun and Moon are rising or culminating, visible before the eyes, either in an open, bright, sacred, or public place, say so. If Kronos (Saturn) is conjunct^1🤖 the Sun, he designates the thieves as freedmen; but if Hermes (Mercury) is also together with them, then both slaves and freedmen. If Zeus (Jupiter) is with the Sun or the Moon, the master of the house will be [---]^2, he is the thief. If Ares (Mars) is with either the Moon or the Sun, he indicates the thieves are slaves or freedmen, and given to anger and violence. If Aphrodite (Venus) is with the Moon in her own house or that of Zeus, she indicates freedmen. If Hermes is with the Sun or the Moon, a boy or adolescent. If the stars are under the rays of the Sun, they indicate the thieves are elders, and the Moon, old women; but those in the east (i.e., rising), outside, are younger, and those in the west, middle-aged. 

Also examine from the stars and their phases in this way: Hermes signifies children, Ares young men, Zeus those of middle age, Kronos elders.

If the Moon is with the Sun in the lower hemisphere (i.e., below the horizon)^3🤖, she indicates that the lost items can be found; if the Moon and Sun are at the culmination (midheaven), they make the items findable through an unilluminated phase. The planet signifying the thief, if it happens to be in its own exaltation, indicates someone tall; if in its fall, someone small or short; and according to the distances between exaltations and falls, so too the ages. If, on the seventh day from the theft, the significator of the thief is under the rays of the Sun, the thief will suffer greatly [and...].^4🤖 But if Ares testifies to the Lot of Fortune, he will fall into wounds, tortures, or dangers. If the Lot of Fortune is not aspected^5🤖 by any malefic, say no theft occurred; and if the Sun has already [reached/aspected] the Lot of Fortune, [---] say it is lost.

If Kronos is in a sign of the lower hemisphere (i.e., under the horizon), he is in a dark, deep place; if Ares, he is very near a smith, carpenter, or stone-worker; if Hermes, very near a schoolmaster, jurist, banker, or magistrate. If neither the Sun nor the Moon aspects^6🤖 the Ascendant, the theft is hard to find. The Moon in the lower hemisphere makes the finding difficult.

Whenever you wish to know where the stolen object lies or to where it has been carried away, consider which sign is present at the anti-midheaven (Imum Coeli/IC)^7🤖, and whose house it is. Aquatic animals (i.e., if the sign is such) indicate a well, spring, cistern, or similar places; quadrupeds imply woodlands, mountains, especially where quadrupeds are stalled or graze^8🤖; anthropomorphic signs that it has gone into someone's hands or has been given to someone. If Zeus and Aphrodite are present in this way, it will be placed in a clean, fine-looking place; if Kronos, in a dark, deep or high and dirty place; if Ares, in a workshop or smithy or kitchen, near fire.

^1🤖 “Conjunct” here renders the Greek “ἐπίκεντρος,” denoting a close astrological configuration—possibly “in the center with” or “in the same degree as” the Sun.  
^2🤖 Brackets [---] indicate a lacuna or unclear reading in the manuscript.  
^3🤖 The Greek “ὑπογείῳ” literally means “under the earth”; in astrological terms, this is “in the lower hemisphere,” i.e., below the horizon.  
^4🤖 The phrase is left open; the Greek construction may be incomplete, suggesting continuation onto the next section of text.  
^5🤖 “Aspected” renders the traditional Greek astrological term “βλέπω,” often translated “look upon” or “cast a ray to.”  
^6🤖 “Aspects the Ascendant”—the technical term in astrology, but traditionally rendered as “casts a ray to the Ascendant.”  
^7🤖 “Anti-midheaven” (Imum Coeli or IC) is the technical astrological term for the nadir or the point opposite the midheaven.  
^8🤖 “Quadrupeds” and “aquatic animals” refer to categories of zodiacal signs, not literal animals, in Hellenistic astrological symbolism.
