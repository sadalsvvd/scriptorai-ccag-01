CODICES FLORENTINI — APPENDIX

say that they are lost. The Sun and the Moon, when they are on the ascendant or at the midheaven, being before the eyes, or lying in an open place or a bright one or sacred or public, say so. Saturn, at the center along with the Sun, denotes thieves who are freedmen; but if Mercury also is together with these, either a slave or a freeman. Jupiter with the Sun or with the Moon is the master of the house, *** will be the thief. Mars with the Moon or with the Sun denotes that the thieves are freedmen or slaves, and quick-tempered and violent. Venus with the Moon in her own house or in Jupiter’s indicates freemen. Mercury with the Sun or the Moon, a boy or youth. The stars, when under the setting of the Sun, indicate that the thieves are older men, and the Moon, old women; but those in the east, outside, younger; in the west, those of middle age. But consider also from the stars and their phases thus: Mercury indicates boys, Mars young men, Jupiter men in their prime, Saturn the elderly. The Moon with the Sun in the lower hemisphere indicates that the lost items are retrievable; the Moon and Sun at the midheaven make them recoverable through an unseen phase. The one signifying the thief, if it happens to be in its own exaltation, indicates tall, but if in depression, short or small; and according to the distances of the exaltations and depressions, the ages. If, moreover, after seven days from the theft, the one signifying the thief is born under the Sun’s concealment, the thief will suffer greatly; if Mars bears witness in respect to the Lot of Fortune, he will fall into wounds or torments or dangers. If a malefic does not behold the Lot of Fortune, say that the theft has not occurred; and if the Sun has already reached the Lot of Fortune, *** say that it is lost. If Saturn is in the sign of the lower hemisphere, it will be in a dark place or a deep one. But if Mars, very near a smith or carpenter or mosaic-worker. If Mercury, very near a teacher or jurist or banker or scribe. If neither the Sun nor the Moon look at the ascendant, the theft is hard to recover; the Moon in the lower hemisphere, recovery is difficult. Whenever you wish to know where the stolen item lies or has been carried away, then observe in the lower midheaven what sign is present and whose house it is. For all signs which are aquatic animals indicate it is in a well or spring or cistern or somewhere similar; but four-footed animals indicate premises of wood, mountains, especially where quadrupeds are stabled or pastured; anthropomorphic signs indicate that it has been brought into someone's hands or has been given to someone. If Jupiter and Venus are there, it will lie in a place clean and of good appearance. If Saturn, in a dark, deep, or high unclean place. But if Mars, in a place for carpentry or smithing or in a kitchen near a fire.
