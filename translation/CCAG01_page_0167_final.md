The Sun, observing the Lot of Daimon, causes childlessness. The Sun, possessing the Lot of Disease, produces cardiac disease. Zeus, observing the Lot of Daimon, causes such a person to become the recipient of oracles or warnings from gods and through dreams, and all divine things are favorable, whether Zeus is in a square or opposition aspect.^1🤖 The ruler of the Lot of Fortune, when under the rays of the Sun, gives violent death according to the nature of the zodiac sign of the Lot of Fortune; but if he escapes only slightly from the rays of the Sun, they are no longer subject to violent death, but instead wander and are much involved in lawsuits. If benefic planets should observe the Lot, it is no longer a matter of violent death, but rather one has middling fortune. The ruler of both the Lot of Fortune and Daimon, being under the rays, gives violent deaths in accordance with the nature [of the configuration], not truly good, nor altogether base, but always worthy as being at the center. If the Lot of Children falls in the house of Kronos (Saturn) and malefic planets observe the Lot, the firstborn are destroyed; but if the Lot of Children falls in the houses of Ares (Mars) and malefics observe the Lot, the middle children are destroyed; and if the Lot of Children falls in the houses of Hermes (Mercury) and malefics observe it, the youngest are destroyed. If the Lot of Daimon falls in Capricorn, it makes the native forgiving and easily changeable; but if in Aries or Leo or Scorpio, the native is quick-tempered and of a single disposition.

The Sun, observing the Lot of Fortune and having its ruler under its rays, causes the person to be prone to exile. If the ruler of the Lot of the Father is found contrary to its own house, where the Lot of the Father is located, such a one is called a changeling^2🤖. The ruler of the Lot of Fortune, being malefic^3🤖 and observing the Lot, is said to give an evil condition, especially if he is also under the rays or observed by malefic planets. If, at the Lot of Marriage, the Moon happens to be in opposition or square aspect and observes the Lot of Marriage, it gives a marriage with kin, possibly even a sibling^4🤖. If the ruler of the Lot of Marriage is found cadent^5🤖, it is said marriages happen secretly. If Kronos is found to be ruler of the Lot of Marriage and Kronos is in the western place, such a one will be destroyed by a Hermes-type (Hermetic) person; and if also the cadent place is found to be a house of Kronos, the one who does this is of the paternal or maternal family, or even an uncle, and such a one will not be a stranger. If the ruler of the Lot of Marriage is cadent, the man is of lesser repute and …


LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “In a square or opposition aspect” refers to the technical astrological aspects of 90° (square) and 180° (opposition), both of which indicate challenging or significant configurations.

^2🤖 “Changeling” here can also be rendered “[adopted or fostered],” reflecting someone who is not the natural child of their parents or whose origins are ambiguous.

^3🤖 “Malefic” translates the technical term ‘kakodaimon’ (“evil-daimon” or “unfortunate”), indicating a condition or planet that brings negative outcomes.

^4🤖 “Marriage with kin, possibly even a sibling” renders the ambiguity of the original Greek, which can include broader kin or even siblings; exact degree is context dependent.

^5🤖 “Cadent” (from the Latin ‘cadere’, “to fall”) refers to a planet or house in a weak or declining astrological position, rather than “combust,” which means being under the beams of the Sun. The term implies diminished strength or visibility in astrological interpretation.
