16. On disjunct zodiacal signs and those having sympathy toward one another.

Disjunct signs, then, are those which nevertheless have sympathy^1🤖 toward one another: namely, all those signs of equal ascension^2🤖, those that are isodynamic^3🤖, and those that are co-equally balanced^4🤖. For example, signs of equal ascension are Aries and Pisces, Gemini and Capricorn, Cancer and Sagittarius, Virgo and Libra; isodynamic are Gemini and Cancer, Virgo and Aries, Libra and Pisces, Sagittarius and Capricorn; co-equally balanced are Taurus toward Libra, Aries toward Scorpio. In general, signs which are adjacent to one another are entirely disjunct and, as such, are useless for sympathy. 

This chapter contributes to the synanaphorae^5🤖 (mutual relationships) of the signs and the heliacal risings^6🤖 of the stars, and likewise to the friendships and close affinities of men and women, and of parents and siblings, friends, and slaves.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Sympathy” here translates the Greek “συμπάθεια,” a technical term in ancient astrology for cosmic affinities or resonances between signs; some use “affinity,” but “sympathy” is well-established in scholarly works.

^2🤖 “Equal ascension” (ἰσάναφορα) denotes pairs of signs that rise in equal times, a technical astrological relationship. Alternatives include “equally referred” or “equally rising.”

^3🤖 “Isodynamic” (ἰσοδυναμοῦντα) means “of equal strength/power;” this term has strong precedent in astrological technical language.

^4🤖 “Co-equally balanced” (ὁμοζυγοῦντα) literally “sharing the yoke,” often rendered as “counterbalanced signs;” retained as “co-equally balanced” for technical specificity.

^5🤖 “Synanaphorae” is left in transliteration due to its status as a term of art in ancient astrology, with the parenthetical gloss “mutual relationships” for clarity. It refers specifically to the relationships between signs in technical table-arrangement or aspect.

^6🤖 “Heliacal risings” translates “συναντολαί,” describing the first appearance of a star or planet at dawn; this is standard in astronomical and astrological translation.
