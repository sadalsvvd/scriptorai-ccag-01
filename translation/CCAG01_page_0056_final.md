LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Sirius" is the standard astronomical name for the Dog-star (Greek: Κύων), also known as the brightest star in the night sky.

^2🤖 "Square aspect" is the non-jargon equivalent of "quadrature," the technical astrological term for a 90-degree angular relationship between two bodies.

^3🤖 The "feast of chess and the board" refers to the games of chess and backgammon; "the board" (Greek "tablion") is a correction for "tables"/backgammon.

^4🤖 "Climacterics" (Greek: κλιμακτήρ) are critical or pivotal years in a person’s life associated with numerological or astrological significance.

^5🤖 The Greek ἁπαλλαγή ("apallage") may also be translated as "deliverance" or "release"; it refers to the removal or alleviation of evils in astrological contexts.

^6🤖 "Lord of the 20th place": In Greek numerals, κ' stands for 20; check that this matches the manuscript, as astrological "places" correspond to houses in the chart.

^7🤖 "Spathéia" is obscure and possibly a technical or lost term; retained in transliteration pending further context or scholarly consensus.

^8🤖 "Heart-strength" is a literal translation of the Greek "καρδιας δύναμις"; it may refer to the innermost or core power of the stars.
