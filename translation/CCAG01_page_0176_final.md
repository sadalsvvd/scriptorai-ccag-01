Concerning all the lots of the ancients:

Lot of Fortune: from ☉ to α (the Ascendant) by day, but by night from α to ☉; and divide from the Ascendant—  
Lot of Daimon: from ☉ to α by day, but by night the reverse, and likewise from the Ascendant; (fol. 133r)—  
Lot of Basis by day: from Fortune to Daimon.

Many others of this sort follow.

Des. fol. 133v:  
All the aforementioned lots are calculated from the Ascendant, except for those specifically noted.

f. 140v. From the Astrological Matters of Eutocius¹.

It is necessary to show also how one must set forth the reckoning of the topic for interpretation,  
borrowing from those concerning nativities just as much as is required for the indication concerning the man whose fate is being perfected—  
that is, the triangles and the houses, the exaltations and the depressions.

¹ [It seemed desirable to publish at least the beginning of this treatise, of a by no means ignoble mathematician (cf. Heiberg, Ueber Eutokios, Jahrb. für class. Philol., Suppl. XI [1880], p. 357 ff.), especially since from the chronological indications on p. 171, v. 4, which correspond to the year 498–499 CE, the opinion of Paul Tannery—who argued in Bulletin des sciences mathématiques, 2nd series, VIII (1884), p. 317 ff., that Eutocius was born not, as believed, in the sixth century, but before the year 480—is clearly confirmed. — F.
