f. 140v. From the astrological writings of Eutocius¹:

It is necessary to indicate how one must expound the assessment of the subject being proposed,  
borrowing from genethlialogy only as much as is required for recalling the derived judgment,  
that is, both the trigons and the houses, the exaltations and the depressions, and so forth.

¹ [At least the beginning of this treatise seemed worth publishing, the author being a mathematician by no means undistinguished (cf. Heiberg, Ueber Eutokios, Jahrb. für class. Philol., Suppl. XI [1880], p. 357ff.), especially since the chronological details on p. 171, v. 4, which agree with the year 498–499 AD, clearly confirm the opinion of Paul Tannery, who in the Bulletin des sciences mathématiques, 2nd series, VIII (1884), p. 317ff., contended that Eutocius was born not, as was previously believed, in the sixth century, but before the year 480. — F. C.]

^1🤖 On "Lot of Life" (κλῆρος ζωῆς) and "Lot of Living" (κλῆρος βίου): Both terms may refer to similar concepts—the span or quality of life—within astrological tradition, but are listed separately in the source. The English distinction reflects this dual usage; alternate renderings are possible.

^2🤖 Δʹ most likely refers to the numeral "4" or the fourth sign/house, but its precise meaning is unclear in context; as noted in the manuscript, "I do not understand the sign (Δʹ)."
