The Persians, who worship fire, reckon the year of the sun apart from the fourth, the intercalary period consisting of thirty-five days; for indeed, the duration of their year comes to thirty-five days. The Egyptians reckon the year as the Persians do, and those from Adam have likewise computed the years as these now do. The Hebrews, the Indians, and the Hittites reckon their years chiefly by the sun, and likewise also their months primarily by the moon; and they reckon the beginning of the month from the conjunction of the sun and the moon, such that this conjunction may fall with either the sun or the moon, before or after midday; and they count the beginning of the month from the day following the conjunction.

The Indians reckon the beginning of their year from the time when the sun comes near Aries; but if it is close to the [standing point] or ..........., from this they reckon it.^1ü§ñ The Hebrews reckon the beginning of their year from the time when the sun comes near Libra. The beginning of the year for the Hittites is when the sun enters Aquarius‚Äîeither exactly, or at the middle, or at the end, or at the beginning [of Aquarius].

Since these have reckoned the year by the sun and the months by the moon, they have found that, between the solar and lunar year, there is a difference of ten days and five supernumerary; so it results that in seven years there is a surplus of one month. Thus, the first of these years is an intercalary one, that is, it has thirteen months. Each nation gave its own name to this month: the Indians, Gatmasan; the Hebrews, Embir; and the Hittites, Soun.

Since the purpose of reckoning years and days for calculation has been stated, though it is not to be applied uniformly in all computations, still this teaching should be the foundation for all calculations. It is necessary, then, to set forth also the other methods and procedures of the discipline, as have been mentioned in the table of Alai.^2 In that table of Alai, seven chapters have been set forth, and the subject of the first chapter is the teaching concerning cycles, as will follow.

Since the years have now been defined as each nation has established, and the cycle of each will be named, therefore the cycle is the foundation, and the years have their basis in it, through the distinguishing feature of the other cycles. Now that foundation ought to be maintained from the year‚Äînamely, that in the year‚Äî
