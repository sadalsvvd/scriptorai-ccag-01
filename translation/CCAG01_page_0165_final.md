APPENDIX

39. On Void Course.

A void course of the Moon occurs when she is not applying to any [planet], neither bodily nor by aspect.

40. On Homorrhoesis (“flowing together”).

Homorrhoesis is when stars are in the same bounds, whether bodily, by aspect, or by observing each other in the bounds of the same star.

41. On Interposition.

Interposition is when two planets have one intermediate [planet] between them in whatever aspect possible, with no other [planet] casting a ray among the intermediates within seven degrees forward or backward.

42. On Planets in Power.

A planet is said to be “in power” whenever it happens to be in its own house or exaltation or bounds or in its own phase or configuration or in some stronger place of the twelve divisions.

43. On Planets in Their Own Light.

Planets are in their own light whenever they are found in their own house or exaltation or bounds; and they take pleasure in these places even if they are found under the rays of the Sun; for the benefics increase the good, and the malefics turn to beneficence.

44. On How the Planets Take Pleasure.

The planets are said to take pleasure: Kronos (Saturn), Zeus (Jupiter), and Ares (Mars) when configured together; Selene (the Moon) and Aphrodite (Venus) as evening stars. Furthermore, Kronos, Zeus, and Ares take pleasure when configured in the quadrants from the Ascendant to the Midheaven and from the Descendant to the lower Midheaven, and Selene and Aphrodite in the alternate quadrants. Hermes (Mercury) in both, since he is of common nature. And the diurnal planets, when above the earth by day, take pleasure, while the nocturnal ones take pleasure below the earth; and by night, the nocturnal planets above the earth take pleasure, while the diurnal take pleasure below.
