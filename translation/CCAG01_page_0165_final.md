APPENDIX

39. On Void Course.

A void course (kenodromia) of the Moon occurs whenever she forms no aspect with any planet, either bodily or by configuration.^1🤖

40. On Homorroēsis.

Homorroēsis occurs when stars^2 are within the same boundaries, either by body, by configuration, or when they observe^3 each other within the boundaries of the same star.

41. On Enclosure (emperiochēsis).

Enclosure is when two planets enclose another planet between them, in any configuration whatsoever, with no other planet casting a ray among those enclosed within seven degrees forward or backward.^4🤖

42. On Planets in Power (en dynamei).

A planet is said to be “in power” when it is in its own house, exaltation, boundaries, its own phase, configuration (by aspect), or in a yet more strengthened place among the twelve divisions (houses).^5🤖

43. On Lamps (lampēnai).

Planets are in their own lamps when they are found in their own house, exaltation, or boundaries; and they delight in these placements even when found under the same solar rays.^6🤖 The benefic planets thereby increase good things, while the malefics are transformed toward beneficence.

44. On How the Stars Rejoice.

The stars are said to rejoice as follows: Kronos (Saturn), Zeus (Jupiter), and Ares (Mars), when configured; Selene (the Moon) and Aphrodite (Venus) as evening planets^7🤖. Furthermore, Kronos, Zeus, and Ares rejoice when configured in the quadrants from the Ascendant (horoskopos) to the Midheaven and from the Descendant to the Lower Midheaven; while the Moon and Aphrodite rejoice in the alternate quadrants. Hermes (Mercury) rejoices in both divisions, as he participates in both. The diurnal planets above the earth rejoice by day, the nocturnal ones below; and again, the nocturnal ones above the earth rejoice by night, the diurnal ones below.


LLM Translation Footnotes

1. “Forms no aspect”: That is, the Moon does not apply to any planetary aspect, neither by bodily conjunction nor by any other astrological configuration.  
2. “Stars”: The Greek ἀστέρες refers both to planets and fixed stars, but here primarily means planets.  
3. “Observe”: The Greek verb can also mean “behold” or “aspect” in astrological terms.  
4. “Casting a ray”: Traditional astrological language for sending any kind of aspect. The seven-degree range applies both forwards and backwards from the planet being enclosed.  
5. “Yet more strengthened place among the twelve divisions”: This refers to stronger or more effective houses in the system of twelve astrological houses.  
6. “Under the same solar rays”: That is, even when combust (near the Sun), planets are still dignified if in their own house, exaltation, or boundaries.  
7. “Evening planets”: Greek ἑσπέριοι, meaning when the Moon and Venus are west of the Sun, and thus visible as evening stars.
