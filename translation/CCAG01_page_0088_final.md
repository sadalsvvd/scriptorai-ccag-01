…of the books. And for this reason, confusion arises in the mind of anyone reading these things. But I have compiled such a book, concisely indicating therein the uncontested doctrines and the best among the treatises, both from the books of Ptolemy and Hermes, the great and most learned sages, as well as from the books bequeathed by those before me to their sons as an inheritance. The authors of these books are as follows:

Hermes composed twenty-four (24) books: sixteen (16) on nativities, five (5) on questions, two (2) on the lots of the signs, and one (1) on calculation.

Plato composed seven (7) books: namely, five (5) on nativities and two (2) on questions.

Dorotheus composed eleven (11) books: namely, four (4) on nativities, three (3) on questions, three (3) on calculation, and one (1) on conjunctions.

Democritus composed fourteen (14) books: namely, seven (7) on nativities, four (4) on questions, two (2) on conjunctions, one (1) on calculation, and one (1) on climates.

Aristotle composed ten (10) books: namely, three (3) on nativities, two (2) on questions, and five (5) on the power of the stars and the signs and their concordances.

Antikus^1🤖 composed seven (7) books: that is, five (5) on nativities and two (2) on questions.

Vallēs^2🤖 composed ten (10) books, containing the powers of all the books.

Erasistratus composed eleven (11) books: that is, four (4) on nativities, one (1) on the power of the Sun in relation to the stars, one (1) on calculation, two (2) on questions, two (2) on conjunctions, and one (1) on phartaria^3🤖.

And Stochos^4🤖 composed seven (7) books: that is, three (3) on nativities, one (1) on eclipses, one (1) on conjunctions, and one (1) on good and bad fortunes.

The Persians composed forty-four (44) books, in which they declared both things past and things to come. And they also composed two other great and necessary books: the first (1) on nativities, the second (1) on questions, each book having one main chapter, and each chapter, in turn, having four (4) discourses (logoi)^5🤖; which are also extant in Indian, not having been transmitted to us^6🤖.

These are the books found in our own days, about which I have, as stated, given an account, so that you may know how much labor I undertook in order to compile and compose the present book, from the aforementioned works, concisely in four discourses (logoi).^5🤖

^1🤖 “Antikus” is likely to be Antiochus (see editorial note), whose name appears in other traditions as Antikus.  
^2🤖 “Vallēs” (Greek Οὐάλης) is an obscure name; it may refer to Valens or another authority, but its precise identification is uncertain.  
^3🤖 “Phartaria” (Greek φαρταρίων) is a transliterated technical term whose meaning remains unclear; likely an astrological or astronomical category.  
^4🤖 The identification of “Stochos” is uncertain; it may be a corruption of Stoichos, Stoikos, or another name.  
^5🤖 “Discourses (logoi)” renders the Greek λόγοι, which could alternatively mean “treatises,” “chapters,” or “tracts.”  
^6🤖 The phrase “extant in Indian, not having been transmitted to us” indicates that these works are known in Indian tradition (likely as Sanskrit translations or compilations), but are not available in the present collection.
