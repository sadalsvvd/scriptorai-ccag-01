…of the books; and for this reason, confusion arises in the mind of the one reading these things. But I have set forth such a book, concisely showing within it the indisputable points and the superior doctrines both from the books of Ptolemy and of Hermes, the great and exceedingly learned sages, as well as from the books left by those before me to their sons as inheritance. Those who set forth the books are as follows:

Hermes set forth twenty-four (24) books, of which sixteen (16) are on nativities, five (5) on questions, two (2) on the lots of the signs, and one (1) on calculation.

Plato: seven (7) books; namely, five (5) on nativities, and two (2) on questions.

Dorotheus: eleven (11) books; namely, four (4) on nativities, three (3) on questions, three (3) on calculation, and one (1) on conjunctions.

Democritus: fourteen (14) books; namely, seven (7) on nativities, four (4) on questions, two (2) on conjunctions, one (1) on calculation, and one (1) on climates.

Aristotle: ten (10) books; namely, three (3) on nativities, two (2) on questions, and five (5) on the power of the stars and the signs and their concord.

Antikous: seven (7) books; namely, five (5) on nativities, and two (2) on questions.

Vales: ten (10) books containing the powers of all the books.

Erasistratus: eleven (11) books; namely, four (4) on nativities, one (1) on the power of the Sun in relation to the stars, one (1) on calculation, two (2) on questions, two (2) on conjunctions, and one (1) on ‘phartaria.’

Stoichos: seven (7) books; namely, three (3) on nativities, one (1) on eclipses, one (1) on conjunctions, and one (1) on fortunes and misfortunes.

The Persians set forth forty-four (44) books, in which they disclosed both past and future matters. They also produced two other great and necessary books, the first concerning nativities and the other concerning questions, each book having one (1) chapter, and each chapter, in turn, having four (4) treatises; and these are handed down in India, not sent out to us.

These are the books found in our own times, about which, as stated, I have given an account, so that you may know that I have labored much to extract and set forth the present book from the aforementioned books, concisely, in four treatises.
