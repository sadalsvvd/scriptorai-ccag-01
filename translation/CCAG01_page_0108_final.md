...on the basis of the testimonies, the distinction or the day’s disposition allows for a judgment. If the testimony of the benefic planets appears stronger, or if also the Moon conjoins a benefic star on the third day, the crisis—or the disease—will be without danger; but if the testimony of the malefic planets happens to be stronger, the person in crisis (i.e., the patient) will die. The quality of the crisis, or of the disease—that is, the corruption—will be recognized from the nature of the sign where the Moon is, and from the star from which she is separating or to which she is applying. For if the Moon is in a cardinal (tropical) sign, the outcome will conclude quickly; if in a double-bodied (bicorporeal) sign, it will proceed moderately; but if in a fixed or commanding sign, it signifies slowness. The same applies if she separates from a star that is a foundation point; and whenever, with the Moon being in a commanding sign, the commanding star is afflicted, the danger will be more hazardous. One must also consider the ruler (oikodespotes) and the director (poleuon), and the lord of the hour, as I wrote in the discussion of beginnings.

1 scarcely correct. 3 ἤτοι in the manuscript is doubtful. 6 "will be recognized" in the manuscript. 7 "and if also" in the manuscript. 8 "is" or "should it be" in the manuscript. 11 "separates" in the manuscript, corrected by Kroll. Regarding ἀπορραίνει, it is scarcely conceivable. "is afflicted" in the manuscript. 12–13 "as...I wrote," cf. cap. 10 v 1 following.

F. 112v (235v). 57. Beginning of a Ship’s Voyage.

Someone set out from Caesarea in the year of Diocletian 241, in the month of October, on the 8th, a Thursday; Sun in Libra..., Moon in Scorpio 27°, 33', Saturn in Cancer 27°, Jupiter in Virgo 17°, Mars in Gemini 12°, Venus in Leo 28°, Hermes (Mercury) in Libra 25°, Ascendant in Sagittarius 7°, Midheaven in Virgo 18°, “anabibazon” [hour-marker] in Cancer 12°.—Because the Moon happened to be in the terms of Saturn, was afflicted, and signified slowness and winter, he caused such things to occur during the voyage; and the opposition of Mars to Mercury brought damage to the masts of the ship and caused struggle and conflict on board. But ... the inception was not harmed because of the lord of the Ascendant; and Venus, found in a terrestrial sign and aspected by both Saturn and Mars, ... and he was loved with exemption in the affair with the woman because the squares of the terrestrial signs were aspected by benefics; and the double-bodied (bicorporeal) sign of the Ascendant and of Jupiter made him board another ship from Abydus; and when the Moon came into Libra opposing Mars by position, with Mars in Taurus opposing the position of the Moon, and the departure was from like-minded (homozynoi) signs, behold, also the entry into like-minded signs was concluded.

2 "Caesarea": I understand Caesarea of Palestine. 241 = 475 A.D. There is a difficulty about the name of the month: it seems to be October. 3 After "Libra" a numeral is omitted in a lacuna. 7 "terms" in manuscript. 8 "to occur" supplied by me. 11 after "But" lacuna of four letters. 13 after "aspected" lacuna of about six letters. "by" supplied by Kroll. 17 "like-minded" in the manuscript, corrected by Kroll.
