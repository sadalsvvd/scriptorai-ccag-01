...on the testimony of witnesses, the difference or the day itself determines; if the testimony of the benefics appears stronger, or if the Moon on the third day should conjoin with a benefic star, the crisis or the illness will be without danger; but if the testimony of the malefics happens to be stronger, the one in crisis, or the one ill, will perish. The quality of the crisis or of the illness—or rather, the destruction—will be recognized from the nature of the zodiac sign in which the Moon is located and from the star from which it is departing, or from its conjunction. For if the Moon is in a tropical sign, the matter will quickly come to its conclusion; if in a double-bodied (mutable)^1🤖 sign, it will proceed moderately; if in a solid or connected sign, it indicates slowness. The same is true even if the Moon is departing from a fixed star; and if, when the Moon is in a connected sign, the connection is afflicted, the danger will be more precarious. One must also take into account the ruler and steward, as well as the lord of the hour, as I have outlined for you at the beginning in this connection.

F. 112v (235v). 57. Inception of a Voyage.

Someone set out from Caesarea in the 241st year of Diocletian (= 475 A.D.), in the month of October, on the 8th, a Thursday: the Sun in Libra, the Moon at 27°33′ Scorpio, Saturn at 27° Cancer, Jupiter at 17° Virgo, Mars at 12° Gemini, Venus at 28° Leo, Mercury (Hermes)^2🤖 at 25° Libra, the Ascendant at 7° Sagittarius, the Midheaven at 18° Virgo, the Anabibazon^3🤖 at 12° Cancer. — Because the Moon happened to be in the bounds of Saturn and was afflicted, and indicated a winter of hardship and slowness in movement, such a condition arose for the voyage; and the opposition of Mars to Mercury caused the necks^4🤖 of the ship to suffer and brought about strife and encounters upon the vessel. However, the inception was not inauspicious on account of the lord of the Ascendant; and Venus, found in a terrestrial sign and observed by Saturn and Mars, moreover, a meeting near a woman was favored because the squares of the terrestrial signs were beheld by benefics; and the double-bodied^5🤖 nature of the Ascendant and of Jupiter caused him to transfer to another ship from Abydus; and when the Moon entered Libra, opposing the natal Mars—Mars being in Taurus and opposing the natal Moon—and the departure was from those sharing the same lot^6🤖, behold, the entry among those sharing the same lot also came to an end.
