LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Corruption” (φθορά) is often used in Greek philosophical and astrological texts as the antithesis of “generation” (γένεσις), meaning decay or destruction, but with a technical nuance distinct from modern “corruption.”

^2🤖 The Greek term likely refers to “degrees” (μοιρῶν) within the context of zodiacal signs, a standard technical term in astrology.

^3🤖 The Greek includes an editorial clarification (read: sterile), correcting to the standard form for “barren” or “sterile.”

^4🤖 The tripartite classification probably refers to animals that vocalize, those that are intermediate, and those that are voiceless.

^5🤖 “Twelve places” (δωδεκάτοπος/ib’ τόπων) generally refers to the astrological houses, not zodiacal signs, unless the context of the source text suggests otherwise.

^6🤖 The word “empeirischēsis” is left in transliterated form due to uncertainty; it is likely a technical term or a textual corruption.

^7🤖 Standard English names for planets are used, with “Hermes (Mercury)” clarified for readers.
