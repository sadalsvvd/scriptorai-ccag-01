LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 The Greek "πολύσπερμα" literally means "much-seeded" or "producing much semen," and indicates high fertility—thus "multiparous."
2. ^2🤖 "πολύγονα" means "bearing many children" or "giving birth to many," hence "polygynous" or "prolific"—with nuance of producing many at once.
3. ^3🤖 "ὀλιγόγονα" means "bearing few offspring," thus "oligogynous," a technical term in astrological context.
4. ^4🤖 The Greek term ("μελεοκοπούμενα") is rare; "mutilated" best conveys its meaning, i.e., having cut or wounded members.
5. ^5🤖 "Biform" means "two-formed" or "double-natured;" both convey the idea of possessing two natures in ancient astrological terminology.
6. ^6🤖 "Bicolored" refers to being of two colors, especially in reference to skin diseases like vitiligo described here.
7. ^7🤖 "Ichthyic" derives from Greek "ἰχθύς" (fish); used for technical astrological classes, often connected to scaliness or aquatic features.
8. ^8🤖 "Scalelike" translates "λεπτυδὴ," which can mean thin, fine, or scaly; here, "scalelike" brings out the association with scales.
9. ^9🤖 The source text seems to have a lacuna or unreadable symbol here; "***" is retained to indicate this gap.
