...of the Moon; therefore, observe: whenever the lord of the year is a malefic and is at the horoscope, or is at the setting [angle], it signifies drought; and whenever a malefic is at an angle not related to the year, but on the other hand, whenever a benefic is at one of the angles and another malefic is below the earth, it also signifies drought. And when the one of Jupiter or of Venus and the one of Hermes [Mercury] and the Moon are at the Water-Observer (that is, the angle relating to water) or at the setting [angle], it signifies rainfall; but if they are at either of the other two angles, it signifies moderate rain, especially when the malefics are declining [i.e., not angular]. If the Moon is together with Hermes [Mercury], in any sign of the zodiac, at one of the angles, especially the one beneath the earth, it signifies that there will be rain everywhere. And whenever both the benefics and the malefics have declined from the angles, and only the Moon and Hermes [Mercury] are angular, they signify rainfall; and whenever the malefic is angular, but the benefic is at the setting [angle] or beneath the earth, they signify moderate rain. More precisely, if both the benefic and the malefic are at one of the angles, but when the malefics are at the angles and the Moon with Hermes [Mercury] are either together or declining, they signify rainfall; but when the malefics have a relation to the year, in some places it rains, in others not. Nevertheless, one must take as the star of the year that which signifies the rain—that is, the one at the Water-Observer or at the setting [angle], or the one transitioning from one sign of the zodiac to another. And I have found by experience that, whenever a benefic is found at any angle, it is necessary to make a combination from it and from the sign upon which it is situated. One should also know, in the season of rain, that the following zodiacal signs are suitable: Pisces, Capricorn, Cancer, Leo, Aquarius; and among these six, Leo and Aquarius are more conducive to rain. And regarding the rain-bringing stars, I declare them to be the Moon, Venus, and Hermes [Mercury]; and of the three, Hermes...
