…of the Moon. Therefore, consider: whenever the ruler of the year is malefic and is rising^1🤖, or is in the setting pivot, it indicates drought; and whenever a malefic is at a pivot without relevance to the year; but conversely, whenever the benefic is upon one of the pivots while another malefic is below the earth, it also signifies drought. And whenever the planet of Zeus (Jupiter), or that of Aphrodite (Venus), or that of Hermes (Mercury), along with the Moon, is at the “water-watching” place or at the setting pivot, it signifies rainfall; but if in the other two pivots, it indicates moderate rain, especially when the malefics have declined. If the Moon, together with Hermes (Mercury), is in any aspect or zodiacal sign^2🤖 upon one of the pivots, and especially the subterranean^3🤖 one (i.e., the Imum Coeli), it indicates that there will be rain everywhere. And whenever the benefics together and the malefics turn away from the pivots, but only the Moon and Hermes (Mercury) are at pivots, they indicate rain; and whenever the malefic is at a pivot and a benefic is at the setting or below the earth, they signify moderate rain. But, even more precisely, if both the benefic and malefic are upon one of the pivots; and whenever the malefics are at the pivots and the Moon together with Hermes (Mercury) is either in the declining places, they signify rainfall. And whenever the malefics have a relationship to the year, in some places it rains, in others it does not. Nevertheless, we must take the year’s star, that is, the one signifying the rain, the one at the water-watching place, or at the setting, or the one transiting from sign to sign. In my experience, whenever a benefic is found at any pivot whatsoever, a combination ought to be made from it and from the sign upon which it stands. One must also know that, at the season of rain, the following signs are appropriate: Pisces, Capricorn, Cancer, Leo, Aquarius; and of these six, Leo and Aquarius are more productive of rain. As rain-bringing stars I consider the Moon, Aphrodite (Venus), and Hermes (Mercury); and among the three, Hermes (Mercury)…

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 ὡροσκοπῇ (“is at the horoscope”) often refers to the ascendant or the rising point of the zodiac; I have rendered it as “is rising,” but “is at the ascendant” is also possible.
2. ^2🤖 ἐν ὄψῳ δήποτε Ζωδίῳ could mean "in whatever aspect or sign"; ὄψις means “aspect” in technical astrology, but the context allows for “in any zodiacal sign.” Both readings are possible, depending on whether the author is emphasizing positionality or aspectual relationship.
3. ^3🤖 The "subterranean" pivot refers to the Imum Coeli (IC, the point directly beneath the earth), one of the four main pivots (angles) in Hellenistic astrology.
