F. 23v. Another lot of Hyphila <sic> among the thirty. Lot of Hyphilae among the thirty-six.^1🤖

F. 24. On decumbitures (In the decumbitures of the sick, examine both the horoscope—and the illness will be [manifest]). On vomiting and purgation (When the Moon is in Aries and Taurus—in the descending application).

F. 25. How one ought to examine the transits of the times and what happens therein in the four turnings of the year (Since, then, the beginning of the year occurs when the Sun is at the beginning of Aries—the first equinox).

F. 25v. On the quarters of the year (Since, then, it is found—and that good man deemed it right that it too should be the same).

F. 28v. On the effects of Ptolemy (rubric). Incipit: The preliminaries Ptolemy composes are addressed to those who do not consider astrology to be an art. Ends: In the first book of Ptolemy to Syrus concerning effects <sic>. Next, the second book begins (f. 51v): Division of the general inquiry (Now, indeed, the most important of the tabular matters earlier set forth…). Ends: we shall say that the multiplication that has occurred is the time of the conjunction^2🤖.

F. 58v. Compilation by the same Theophilus concerning cosmic commencements^3 [“by the same” erased, but as it seems in other ink] (The beginning of the year—as we have set forth). Edited in the appendix.

F. 59v. Effects of the annual period as I have compiled from the ancients (How it ought to be apprehended—and successively concerning the rest).

F. 61. On the annual lord = codex 8, f. 175v. On the month (We must examine—the day is unlucky). Petosiris to Nechepsos^4 concerning a good and bad month (Nor is it unreasonable for you to know this, greatest king—because of Cancer and especially when the other stars are setting); marginal scholia are added^5 = codex 8, f. 177v.

¹ Folios 28v–56r comprise anonymous commentaries on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, printed in Basel, 1559, book I and II, pp. 1–63 line 21 “places.” Folio 56 ends the seventh quire; already in the sixteenth century, a learned man noted in the margin of fol. 56v “four leaves seem to be missing (λέπεται τέτταρα(?)).” What follows from fol. 57r up to fol. 58v is found in book IV of the same commentary, from page 176 up to p. 179 line 37. — Everything was collated by Boll, to whom we owe this.

² What you find on folios 58v–75 is repeated on ff. 59–80 of codex Parisinus 1991 (cf. above, p. 61, n. 1).

³ Kroll conjectured, though with hesitation, that the work “On the Month” is by Nechepsos, on the basis of Marciani 335, f. 340v, and 336, f. 278r.

⁴ Cf. Riess, Nechepsonis et Petosiridis fragmenta, p. 365, no. 20 ff., who, however, differs from this. Kroll noted that another letter of Petosiris to Nechepsos is found in cod. Mutinensis 174, f. 262.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖: The personal name appears in varying forms (“Hyphila,” “Hyphilae”) in the manuscript; I have preserved the form as given, noting <sic> to reflect textual uncertainty. Alternative readings might include “Hyphilos.” The use of “lot” vs. “table” depends on the underlying Greek (likely “κλῆρος”), which is standard in astrological texts.  
^2🤖: The word translated as “conjunction” here is Greek κολλήσεως, which can also mean “attachment” or “joining,” but “conjunction” is the established astrological term.  
^3🤖: The Greek term for “commencements” (ἀρχαί) can also mean “beginnings” or “initiations”; “cosmic commencements” is a standard phrasing in astrological literature.  
^4🤖: The work “On the Month” is tentatively attributed to Nechepsos based on manuscript comparison; the textual tradition is not certain.  
^5🤖: Scholia (marginal notes) are present in the manuscript and have been referenced to codex 8, f. 177v.
