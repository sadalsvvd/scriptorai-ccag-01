F. 23v. Another lot [psēphos] of Hyphilos [sic] concerning the thirty. Lot of Hyphilos concerning the thirty-six.

F. 24. On crises (In the crises of the sick, observe also the horoscope — the illness will result). On vomiting and purgation (When the Moon is in Aries and Taurus — in the descending aspect).

F. 25. How one ought to examine the transits of the years and the things happening therein during the four turning points of the year (Since, therefore, the beginning of the year occurs when the Sun is at the beginning of Aries — the first equinox).

F. 25v. On the quadrants of the year (Since, therefore, it is found — and he himself considered it proper to be so).

F. 28v. On the outcomes of Ptolemy (rubric). Inc.: Ptolemy presents the proemia (introductions) to those who do not consider astrology to be an art. Des.: To the first Book of Ptolemy to Syrus concerning the outcomes [sic]. Then incipit Book II (f. 51v): Division of the universal investigation (So then, the chief of those set forth in the tables…). Des.: we will say that the multiplication that has occurred is the time of attachment¹.

F. 58v. Collection by the same Theophilus concerning cosmical commencements² [“by the same” erased but, it seems, in another hand] (The beginning of the year — just as we have arranged). Edited in the appendix.

¹ Folios 28v–56r include anonymous commentaries on Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos printed at Basel, 1559, Books I and II, pages 1–63, line 21, “places.” Folio 56 ends the seventh quire; here, as a certain learned man of the sixteenth century observed in the margin of fol. 56v, many things have already perished: λέπεται τέτταρα(?) φύλλα (“four leaves are missing?”). What follows from fol. 57r to fol. 58v is found in Book IV of the same commentary from page 176 up to page 179, line 37. — All collated by Boll, to whom we owe these things.

² What is found on folios 58v–75 is repeated on ff. 59–80 of Parisinus 1991 (cf. above, p. 61, n. 1).

³ Kroll conjectured with some doubt that the work περὶ μηνὸς of Nechepsos exists, comparing Marcianus 335, f. 340v, 336, f. 278r.

⁴ Cf. Riess, Nechepsonis et Petosiridis Fragmenta, p. 365, no. 20 ff., who nonetheless differs from this. Kroll noted that another epistle of Petosiris to Nechepsos is found in codex Mutinensis 174, f. 262.
