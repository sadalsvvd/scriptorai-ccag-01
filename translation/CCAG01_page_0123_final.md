APPENDIX

He adds certain other things concerning these stars, and presently again speaks about himself (f. 141v):

“These things we have found by staying awake and laboring for a sufficient time, since often upon a nativity, when neither is any configuration found well suited—whether because the luminaries are not at the centers but have even deviated, nor when the benefics are at the centers do we observe very great and most fortunate nativities—those which are without bright stars rising together with the centers or with the Moon, we have not found to participate. On account of this reason, we have set forth both the differences and the efficacy of the bright and notable stars, <all> except for only one, Canopus, because it is much more southern and is scarcely visible in these regions, as I observed in the region through Rome; as for us, then...”

2 μὴ δὲ μιᾶς codex. 3 καὶ omitted by editor. 5 κέντροις [I do not understand]. 8 These bright stars are thirty in number, as the author himself says (see above, p. 80, τῶν λ’ λαμπρῶν ἀστέρων); cf. Porphyry, Introduction, p. 240, ed. 1559, πάντας added. Canopus is thus given in the codex. For similar statements concerning this star, see Manilius, I, 208ff. 9 αὐτῶν] Should it be ἄλλων?

What follows in the testimonia concerning ancient authors (p. 80) has already been presented above. Subjoined is the conclusion:

“Having thus described our own account concerning the power and efficacy of the fixed and bright stars, and having, as far as possible, considered them according to natural philosophy, let us also reasonably ascribe the efficacy and productive quality of the lesser ones.”
