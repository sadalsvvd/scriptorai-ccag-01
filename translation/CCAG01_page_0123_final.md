APPENDIX

He adds certain other things concerning these stars, then again speaks of himself (f. 141v):

These matters we discovered after keeping vigil and laboring for quite some time, since often, in the case of a nativity, with no proper observation being found—neither with the luminaries^1🤖 being at the centers^2🤖, but even deviating from them, nor, when the benefics^3🤖 are at the centers, do we observe nativities that are especially prominent and very fortunate: all of which, except for those bright stars rising together^4🤖 with the centers or the Moon, we have not taken into account. For this reason, we have set forth both the difference and the effect of the bright and notable stars, all except for only one, Canopus, because it lies very far to the south and is scarcely visible in these regions, as I observed in the latitude corresponding to Rome. We, then...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Luminaries” in ancient Greek astrological context refers to the Sun and Moon.
^2🤖 “Centers” is used as a neutral rendering for the Greek “κέντροις,” which might refer to angles (ascendant, midheaven, etc.) or other central points in the astrological chart; its precise meaning is debated among scholars.
^3🤖 “Benefics” are the favorable planets (typically Jupiter and Venus) in astrology, corresponding to the Greek “ἀγαθοποιοί.”
^4🤖 The phrase “rising together” translates the astrological technical term “συνανατελλόντων,” denoting stars that rise at the same time as the centers or the Moon, which implies a particular kind of conjunction at the ascendant.
