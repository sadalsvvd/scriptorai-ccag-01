Helios and Zeus observe, and likewise Selene and Hermes, whenever, as they pass, they come to the place where either Aphrodite or Hermes is. If Aphrodite, coming to the place of the Moon, forms a trine^1🤖 with her, apart from the malefics^2🤖, rain occurs. But whenever neither Hermes nor Aphrodite is at the beginning of the year in any of the aforementioned signs, and they are not harmed by the malefics, but then the Moon and Hermes come to where Aphrodite is, a moderate^3🤖 rain occurs. Therefore, what I have tested is this: observe the ascendant sign at the beginning of the year, the setting sign, the sign of the good daimōn, and that of the evil daimōn,^4🤖 and if you see a destructive planet (malefic)^2🤖 with the Moon coming to these places, rain occurs; likewise, the other two angles^5🤖, even without the testimony of the malefics, produce the same effect. Likewise, Aries together with Libra, when witnessed by malefics, are favorable for rain; likewise also, if the sign of the previous conjunction or Full Moon is found among the aforementioned signs, it does the same.

On the Configurations of the Seven Stars by Julianus:

The star of Kronos (Saturn) is by nature the dimmest in color, traversing the first zone, stationed in cold and unmoving air, in contact with the sphere of the fixed stars, far separated from the sun, and in its movement is slower than the others. In nature, it is moist and cold and crystalline and windy, and is sympathetic to the signs with immoderate temperaments, and destructive to animals and all crops because of its excessive coldness. Accordingly, when it is found in moist signs, it makes the sea tempestuous and brings prolonged rains, cold, and winds, and disturbances or even earthquakes or chasms; but among the fiery signs, it causes whirlwinds, storms, and thick fog.
