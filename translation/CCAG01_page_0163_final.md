APPENDIX

26. On Epidekateia.

Epidekateia and superiority occur when a star positioned in the tenth place forms a square aspect to the left. Cancer will be the Ascendant; thus, those in Aries are superior to the one in Cancer. Another is called superiority, when someone present in the right place observes the one in the left, whether in a triangle, square, or hexagon aspect.^1🤖

27. On Affliction and Unprofitable Places.

Affliction is said to occur when someone is illuminated by malefics or is encompassed by them, or is in conjunction with a destroyer, or in engagement, or in opposition, or is ruled by someone badly positioned in the unprofitable places, which are the sixth from the Ascendant, and the third, and the second, and the eighth, and the twelfth.^2🤖

28. On Profitable Places.

Profitable places are the four angles and each of the second trigons from the Ascendant, and the return of the Midheaven.^3🤖

29. On Appropriation.

Appropriation is said to occur when a star approaches the Sun or the Moon, just as its own house relates to their houses; to the Sun when vespertine^4🤖, to the Moon when matutine.^5🤖 For example, the Sun is in Leo, the Moon in Cancer, and Aphrodite (Venus) in Taurus; when the Sun is in Leo it is evident that it appropriates, for it is in its own house and a masculine sign; but if Aphrodite were in Taurus, she would similarly appropriate when the Moon is matutine and in a feminine sign.

30. On Participation.

Participation is when two planets are present in or regard the same sign, but for the one it is its house, for the other, its exaltation.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Epidekateia” (Ἐπιδεκατεία) is an untranslated technical astrological term referring to a planet being in the tenth place from another, usually forming a square aspect; this and “superiority” (καθυπερτέρησις) denote specific planetary relationships of dominance in Hellenistic astrology. “Left” and “right” refer to zodiacal order, with “left” typically meaning earlier in the zodiac.

^2🤖 “Malefics” indicates the traditional “bad” planets (usually Mars and Saturn). “Destroyer” translates “φθοροποιός,” a technical term for a planet or position that brings ruin. The “unprofitable places” are specific astrological houses (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 12th from the Ascendant) considered unfavorable.

^3🤖 The “second trigons from the Ascendant” are technical groupings in Hellenistic astrology, also rendered as “double triangles” in some translations. “The return of the Midheaven” may refer to the IC (Imum Coeli) or the anti-Midheaven; the phrase is left literal due to ambiguity.

^4🤖 “Vespertine” means “evening,” i.e., approaching from the west or becoming an evening star, relative to the Sun. The technical Latin/Greek term is preserved for precision.

^5🤖 “Matutine” means “morning,” i.e., approaching from the east or becoming a morning star, especially relative to the Moon. Again, the technical term is used for accuracy.
