APPENDIX

26. On Epidekateia (the Tenth-Part Aspect).

Epidekateia and superiority occur when a star, being situated in the tenth place to the left, forms a square aspect to another. Cancer is the Ascendant; therefore, those in Aries have superiority over those in Cancer. Another type of superiority is said to occur when a star, in a right-hand place, regards one in a left-hand triangle (trine), square, or hexagon (sextile).

27. On Affliction and Unprofitable Places.

Affliction is said to occur when a star is illuminated or encompassed by malefics, or is in conjunction with a destroyer, or comes into collision, or is diametrically opposed, or is ruled by one badly situated in the unprofitable places, which are: the sixth from the Ascendant, the third, the second, the eighth, and the twelfth.

28. On Profitable Places.

The profitable places are the four angles and both sets of trines (second triangles) from each of the Ascendant, and the return of the Midheaven.

29. On Idiosprosopia (Proper Appearance or Personalization).

A star is said to have idiosprosopia (proper appearance) when it approaches the Sun or the Moon, just as its own house stands in relation to theirs; to the Sun it is vespertine, to the Moon matutine. For example: the Sun is in Leo, the Moon in Cancer, and Aphrodite (Venus) in Taurus. When the Sun is in Leo, it is clear that it has idiosprosopia, for it is in its own house and a masculine sign. Likewise, if Aphrodite is in Taurus, she has idiosprosopia when the Moon is matutine and in a feminine sign.

30. On Participation.

Participation occurs when two planets are present together in the same sign or regard it by aspect, with one having rulership and the other exaltation.
