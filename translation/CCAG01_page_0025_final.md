LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek manuscript includes a variant: "λόγου καὶ δούλου (read: δόλου)", i.e., "argument or trick" (with "slave" a probable scribal error for "trick"); both are noted for transparency.

^2🤖 The original Greek uses "Hermes," the traditional name for the planet Mercury; both forms are provided on first mention.

^3🤖 The Greek “κορτίνα” may refer to a curtain, tent, or possibly military standard; meanings overlap in ancient sources, and the ambiguity is retained.

^4🤖 “Enmity” reflects traditional astrological terminology for ἔχθρα; “opposition” is another possible rendering, but “enmity” is standard for such texts.

^5🤖 The phrase “not in reversal” (or “not in reverse order”) references a technical method in astrological calculation of the Lots (κλῆροι).

^6🤖 “Iatromathematica” is a technical term for medical astrology; the parenthetical explains for general readers.

^7🤖 "Nothing is increased": the Greek “οὐδὲν ἐπιτίνεται” could also be rendered “nothing is intensified,” but “increased” is idiomatic in context.
