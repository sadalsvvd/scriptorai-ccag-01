…and boundaries and decans and faces and monomoiriai; but let each set out the lots as he wishes, according to the particular need. The sample chart is as follows: Let the year be assumed from the beginning of the reign of Diocletian, which is from the last days of Alexander the Macedonian, in the month Athyr, first day according to the Alexandrians, at the variable hour of the day, towards Alexandria in Egypt, in the seventh hour, twelfth minute.

The epochs, therefore, of the seven wandering stars and their centers and their lots are as follows:  
Sun in Scorpio 4° 22′; Moon in Taurus 18° 10′; Saturn in Aries 24° 28′; Jupiter in Virgo 4° 12′; Mars in Leo 17° 35′; Venus in Cancer 18° 24′; Moon in Taurus 3° 7′; Ascendant in Aries 17° 4′. Sun in Scorpio 4° 22′. . . . . . . . . [A. O.]

And if the clouds appear thick, it indicates there will be heavy hail; but if thin, light hail; if there is dew, it indicates wind; but in particular, the hail will occur where the clouds appeared. But if neither clouds
