CODICES ASTROLOGICI FLORENTINI  
(Florentine Astrological Manuscripts)

In cataloguing the Florentine manuscripts in which astrological works are preserved, we have followed this order:  
I. We examined the manuscripts that contain the works of individual authors;  
II. We described the manuscripts that can be called astrological miscellanies;  
III. We noted those manuscripts that contain only a few leaves with excerpts pertaining to astrology.

It is indeed possible that, besides those which I have taken care to catalogue here, others may remain hidden in the Laurentian Library^1🤖; nevertheless, I would assert that very few remain hidden, for I have explored with the utmost diligence and patience everything that pertained to the undertaking^2🤖. We have added some unpublished fragments ourselves; others are marked with the names of the scholars to whom they belong.

It remains for me to express my deepest gratitude to Fr. Cumont^3🤖, who also wished me to participate in the compilation^4🤖 of the astrological corpus, and most courteously and kindly provided me with a preliminary and rough index of several manuscripts, as well as other aids.

I was writing in Senigallia on the fourth day before the Nones of November, 1887^5🤖.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Laurentian Library" renders "Bibliotheca Laurentiana," referring specifically to the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence.

^2🤖 The phrase "I have explored with the utmost diligence and patience everything that pertained to the undertaking" translates "summā enim diligentia et patientia omnia quae ad inceptum pertinerent, perlustravi," with "perlustravi" carrying the sense of thorough investigation.

^3🤖 "Fr. Cumont": "Fr." is likely an abbreviation of "Frater" (Brother), commonly used for members of religious orders in scholarly works, though it could also abbreviate a first name such as "Francois." The context suggests the religious title is most likely.

^4🤖 The original Latin "in corpore astrologico parando" can be translated as either "in the compilation" or "in the preparation" of the astrological corpus. "Compilation" is chosen here for its process-oriented connotation.

^5🤖 "The fourth day before the Nones of November" refers to the Roman date "ante diem quartum Nonas Novembres." In 1887, this corresponds to November 2nd.
