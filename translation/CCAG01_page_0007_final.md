Astrological Florentine Codices

In examining the Florentine codices in which astrological material is preserved, we have followed this order:
I. We have examined the codices that contain works of individual authors;
II. We have described the codices that may be called astrological miscellanies;
III. We have noted those codices which offer, in only a few leaves, excerpts pertaining to astrology.

Indeed, it is possible that, beyond what I have endeavored to list here, others may lie hidden in the Laurentian Library; nevertheless, I would maintain that very few remain concealed, for I have surveyed, with the utmost diligence and patience, everything which pertained to the undertaking. We have added several unpublished fragments ourselves, others by learned men whose names are indicated for each.

It remains for me to express my profound gratitude to Fr. Cumont, who also wished to have me as a participant in the preparation of the astrological corpus, and most kindly and generously furnished me with a preliminary and rough list of some codices, as well as other aids.

I was writing at Senigallia on the 4th day before the Nones of November, 1887.
