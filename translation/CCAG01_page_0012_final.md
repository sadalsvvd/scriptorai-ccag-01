Fol. 1.

////////// An event diagram (horoscope)^1🤖 derived from the indications concerning any beginning^2🤖; these are judged to be unfavorable signs (////////ψμ of the horoscope's sign Sagittarius (?), lord Zeus (Jupiter)^3🤖—to the lord of the ascendant, to Zeus (Jupiter)). Thema^4🤖 cast in the year of the world 6882 — 1374 CE.

Fol. 1v.

And from the indications concerning royal accession, these too are found to be unfavorable (Mars (Ares)^5🤖, being a malefic, opposes the Sun—and the selection is in its favor—while the adversity of the second [house] indicates damage to his flock).

Fol. 2.

<Isaac Argyros>. Commentary^6🤖 on the Persian canons of astronomy (“The composition of the Persian canons was made by the mathematicians there in the first year of Yazdegerd the Sariar, king of the Persians, reckoning by Persian years; and such a year falls after 6396^7🤖 years from the creation of the world (= 631 CE)—and for every canon this was established for the sake of solar eclipses”).

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek refers to a horoscope or event diagram (thema) cast for a specific moment; here translated as “event diagram (horoscope)” for clarity.  
^2🤖 “Indications concerning any beginning” relates to astrological elections or inceptions, i.e., casting charts for the start of significant actions or events.  
^3🤖 “Zeus (Jupiter)” combines the Greek deity with the planetary name per astronomical convention; in Greek manuscripts “Zeus” typically denotes the planet Jupiter.  
^4🤖 “Thema” (θέμα) is the technical term for a nativity or event chart in Greek astrology.  
^5🤖 “Mars (Ares)” gives both the Roman and Greek designations; Mars is the planetary referent, Ares the Greek god used in original manuscripts.  
^6🤖 The Greek “Παράδοσις” can mean “commentary,” “exposition,” or “tradition.” Here, “Commentary” is used as most consistent with scholarly convention; “exposition” is also possible.  
^7🤖 The number of years from the creation of the world appears variously in different manuscripts (e.g., 6396, 6882, 6939, etc.); such discrepancies may reflect diverse chronological eras or scribal error. Here, 6396 is retained with a note that this equates to 631 CE as in the source.
