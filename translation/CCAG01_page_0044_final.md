Fol. 1–2. After the index of the 265 chapters of which the collection of this book consists, there follow ten verses, namely:

The son of Abraham writes this book by hand,  
in which the end of the age falls upon the seventh  
required number, both ten and one hundred years,  
so that the whole race of mortals might take its share,  
upon which, searching for the tightly-winding courses of the planets,  
it tells all its wordless tales to men,  
both good and base things, whatever lies before them from the immortal  
god who sits always in the wide heaven;  
her words, more melodious than much gold,  
those for which, among mortals, the famous longing are shown.

1 [That Eleutherios, the teacher of John the Abrahamite, appears to be the same as the astrologer Eleus of this name, who at Mytilene in the year 1388 A.D. copied the Angelicanus codex 29 (Studi Italiani, vol. IV, [1896], p. 64). For likewise master and disciple, having completed the work, gave thanks to God: ‘Thanks to God, the accomplisher of good things’ (Cod. Ang., fol. 152). — F. C.]
