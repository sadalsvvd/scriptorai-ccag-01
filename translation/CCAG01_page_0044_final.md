The son of Abraham writes this book by hand,  
in which the cycle of the age has attained its closure  
at the seventh, as is fitting—a year reckoned as one hundred and ten—  
to encompass the whole race of mortals, for whom,  
seeking out the densely winding coils of the planets' circuits,  
he tells to mortals all words unsaid,  
both noble and base things as are set before those who dwell with  
the immortal God, always above the broad heaven—  
whose honey-sweet words surpass much gold,  
by which those renowned among mortals are shown, longing.^1🤖

1 [That Eleutherios, teacher of John the Abrahamite, seems to be the same as the astrologer Eleus of this name who at Mytilene in 1388 AD copied the Angelicanus codex 29 (Studi Italiani, vol. IV, [1896], p. 64). For both master and disciple, upon finishing their work, gave thanks to God: “Thanks to God, the accomplisher of good things” (Cod. Ang., fol. 152). — F. C.]

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The poetic translation attempts to preserve both the structure and ambiguity of the Greek. The reference to "year reckoned as one hundred and ten" may allude to a 110-year cycle in an astrological or eschatological context; the exact reckoning is debated. The phrase “whose honey-sweet words surpass much gold” refers to divine utterance or inspired text, with the relative clause’s antecedent somewhat ambiguous in the Greek.
^2🤖 There is uncertainty in the Greek regarding the subject of this "method": "in which sign (τοῦ ἕνεισιν)" may be a corrupted or elliptical expression—editors have flagged this as problematic.
