...appear, nor does dew form, indicate the condition of the month to be fair weather. Now, the night of the 20th of the month indicates the condition of November, the observation being made in the same way as for the corresponding night; the night of the 21st of the month indicates the condition of December. For if clouds appear on this night at evening, it indicates snow at the beginning of December; but if at dawn, about the end of that same month. If dew forms, it indicates wind in that same month. The night of the 22nd of the same month indicates the condition of January; and let this observation likewise be as for the aforesaid night. The 23rd night indicates the condition of February; for if clouds appear at evening, it indicates snow; but if at midnight, it indicates wind; and if in the morning, hail and violent winds. The 25th night indicates the condition of March according to the same observation. The [night corresponding to] the 25th indicates the condition of April; for if clouds appear, it indicates hail; but if dew, wind. The 27th night shows the condition of May, also taking into account the night of October. But one must also know this: if wind arises before the setting of the Pleiades, it indicates an early winter; at the very setting, a moderate one; after some time, a late one.
