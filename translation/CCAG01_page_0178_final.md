…appear, nor does dew form, declare the condition of the month to be fair weather. The 20th night signifies the conditions of November, the observation being conducted in the same way as for the previous night. The 21st night signifies the condition of December: if clouds appear in the evening, it indicates snow at the beginning of December; but if toward dawn, snow will fall toward the end of the same month. If dew forms, it indicates wind for that month. The 22nd night signifies the conditions of January; this observation is to be made in the same way as for the previous night. The 23rd night signifies the conditions of February: if clouds appear in the evening, it signifies snow; if around midnight, it indicates wind; if in the morning, hail and violent winds. The 25th night signifies the conditions of March, by the same observation. On the 25th night, those of April: if clouds appear, it indicates hail; if dew, wind. The 27th night shows the conditions of May, as you have calculated also in the night of October^1🤖. 

You must also know this: if wind arises before the setting of the Pleiades, it means there will be an early winter; if at the very time of their setting, an average winter; but if after some time, a late winter.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "as you have calculated also in the night of October" reflects a syntactical ambiguity in the Greek, which may alternatively be rendered as "as you have conjectured" or "as estimated from the October night"; the precise intention is uncertain.  
^2🤖 "Arbiter" for "βραβεύτης" can also be translated as "judge" or "awarder"; see LLM notes for discussion.
