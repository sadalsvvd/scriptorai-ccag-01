LLM Translation Footnotes

1. 🤖 “Native” here translates ὁ γεννηθεὶς, a technical term in astrology for the person whose nativity/chart is being discussed (i.e., the person who was born).
2. 🤖 “Exalted” may indicate technical astrological exaltation; if the Greek means merely “bright,” then “bright stars” is also plausible.
3. 🤖 “Mathematici” refers to astrologers or astronomers in antique and Byzantine usage, here clarified for modern readers.
4. 🤖 The Greek term may mean “marvelous” or “paradoxical”; “extraordinary” aims to encompass both nuances.
