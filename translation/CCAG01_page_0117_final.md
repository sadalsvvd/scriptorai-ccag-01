APPENDIX

The Sun in the place of siblings.  
But when the Sun has traversed his courses,† the shining star neither inclines favorably,† nor brings back the chariot, nor anything lesser.^1🤖

Cronos in the place of siblings.  
If Cronos should incline toward a third course, blood is brought about among the siblings, bringing many hardships.

Ares in the place of siblings.  
Thereupon Ares assigned a brother as a warrior,  
and with blood he dulled their dreadful aspect as well as their iron.

Zeus in the place of siblings.  
But Zeus granted the strongest lots in greatest number,  
good inheritances, and happiness; and from the departed  
he causes them to prosper and ever bring them great renown.^2🤖

Hermes in the place of siblings.  
And lord Hermes gave manifold steadfast gifts,  
excelling in crafts fashioned by the Muses and Graces.^3🤖

Aphrodite in the place of siblings.  
Then the goddess of Cyprus made poets,  
who prosper especially in the pursuits of friendship.

Selene in the place of parents.  
If, then, Selene, bright with charms, should appear there,  
and in glorious order proceed on her daily course,  
the sign is more fortunate† and flourishes by night; but the worst—  
but if otherwise baleful ones approach her as she appears,  
it is less fortunate, for she brings the burdens of parents.^4🤖

The Sun in the place of parents.  
But the Sun, having come to the father's place, excels;  
and for Selene, the mother is dear, and in every way no evil appears.

Cronos in the place of parents.  
If Cronos should go and attain the lot^5🤖 of the parents,  
he does not show favor, since he sends forth many ills  
and harm, hateful diseases, and grievous ruin;  
making them orphans, he destroys the patrimony both sooner and later.

Zeus in the place of parents.  
Whenever, indeed, Phaethon drives^6🤖 the fourth course,

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "neither inclines favorably, nor brings back the chariot, nor anything lesser" translates the Greek's elliptical and possibly corrupt text, where movement and favor by the Sun are compared to restorative or diminishing courses. The "chariot" is a standard poetic and astrological metaphor for the Sun's path.

^2🤖 The Greek verb "τελέθει" ("he causes them to prosper") is somewhat archaic; the sense here is of Zeus endowing siblings with prosperity and lasting renown, especially from inheritances from the departed.

^3🤖 "Manifold steadfast gifts" translates the Greek "πολυέρκετα δῶρα"—literally, "many-protecting" or "steadfast" gifts—evoking gifts that provide enduring benefit. The excelling in crafts refers to exceptional skill linked to the influence of the Muses and Graces.

^4🤖 The passage on Selene is highly elliptical and possibly corrupt in the original; the sense here is that her appearance, especially at night, brings greater fortune, unless "baleful ones" (malefic planets) are present, in which case she brings the burdens (or sorrows) of parents.

^5🤖 "Lot" here is the technical astrological term "κλῆρος," meaning a portion or fate assigned, often by casting lots; in astrological context, a calculated point relating to inheritance or fate.

^6🤖 "Drives the fourth course" preserves the Greek metaphor for the Sun (here called "Phaethon") as charioteer, controlling movement through the "fourth place" (the Fourth House, i.e., parents).
