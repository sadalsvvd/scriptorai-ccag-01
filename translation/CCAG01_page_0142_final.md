...established as ruler of the entire cosmos, leading all things and being the begetter of all; and indeed he begets all living creatures, but again destroys them, he ripens the fruits and again dries them.

The star of Aphrodite lies beneath the belt of the Sun, after that of Hermes, in a temperate air, being by nature moist, temperate, and feminine, and is the cause of sowing and nourishment; for, receiving from the Sun a transmission of heat and partaking of some moisture from Hermes, it is established as temperate, always accompanying the Sun, sometimes going before him, sometimes following. Therefore, when it happens to be in zodiacal signs sympathetic to it and attending the Sun, it renders the air and the sea calm, and increases, nourishes, and perfects all things upon the earth, and causes the souls of living beings to be robust, making them courageous, calm, and vigorous, rendering the air windless and calm, and making the outpourings of waters seasonable and harmless. But when it happens to be in zodiacal signs unsympathetic to it, it renders the air unhealthy, destructive, and full of winds; especially when it withdraws from the Sun and lingers, it makes the sea tumultuous, damages all the fruits, and causes sickness in living beings.

The star of Hermes lies beneath the belt of Aphrodite, after that of the Moon, being near the earth, in a denser, more vapory, and moist air, being by nature also vapory; for by partaking of the transmission from Aphrodite and the emanation from the Moon, it is made vapory, and always joins in the circuit with the Sun, sometimes going before him, sometimes following, as an attendant, herald, or staff-bearer set over the people and the arrangements of the household for the king. But when it happens to be in zodiacal signs unsympathetic to it and attending the Sun, it throws the air into turmoil, producing thunder, lightning, gloom, sudden assemblies of winds, dust-storms, whirlwinds, tempests, thunderbolts, fires, hailstorms, and earthquakes; and when wrapped in and hidden under the rays of the Sun, it creates variable and disordered states of the air, troubling the sea, destroying the fruits of the earth, and causing sickness in living beings. But when it happens to be in zodiacal signs sympathetic to it, it renders the air temperate and the sea calm, and increases, nourishes, and perfects all things, and harmonizes the souls of living beings to be robust.
