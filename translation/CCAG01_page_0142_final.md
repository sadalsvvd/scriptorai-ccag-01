...having been established as ruler of the entire cosmos, guiding all things and progenitor of all: for he generates all living creatures, yet it is he himself again who destroys them, and he ripens the fruits and dries them up again.

The star of Aphrodite lies beneath the orb of the Sun, after that of Hermes, in a temperate atmosphere, being by its nature moist, temperate, and inclined toward the feminine—cause of both sowing and growth. For it receives the transmission of heat from the Sun and partakes also of a certain moistness from Hermes, so it stands established as temperate, always accompanying the Sun, sometimes preceding it, sometimes following. Thus, whenever it happens to be in zodiacal signs sympathetic to it and acting as attendant to the Sun, it makes both the air and the sea calm and serene, and increases, nourishes, and perfects everything upon the earth; and for living creatures, it produces vigorous souls, making them courageous, gentle^1🤖, and robust, rendering the air windless and serene, and making the outpourings of the waters timely and harmless. But when it happens to be in zodiacal signs unsympathetic to it, it renders the air noxious, destructive, and full of vapor^2🤖; and especially when it withdraws and stands apart from the Sun, it disturbs the sea, harms all fruits, and causes disease among living creatures.

The star of Hermes lies beneath the orb of Aphrodite, after that of the Moon, being close to the earth, in an atmosphere that is denser, more vaporous, and moist, and it too is by nature vaporous. For, partaking of the transmission from Aphrodite and the emission from the Moon, it has become vaporous, always revolving with the Sun—sometimes preceding, sometimes following, like a servant, subordinate, or attendant appointed over the people and their management. Yet when it happens to be in zodiacal signs unsympathetic to it and acting as attendant to the Sun, it disturbs the air, producing thunder, lightning, clouds, sudden gatherings of winds, whirlwinds, storms, winter weather, thunderbolts, fire-wheels, hailstorms, and earthquakes. But when it is enveloped and hidden beneath the rays of the Sun, it produces variable and unstable atmospheric conditions, disturbing the sea, destroying the fruits of the earth, and causing diseases in living things. But when it happens to be in zodiacal signs sympathetic to it, it renders the air temperate and the sea calm, increases, nourishes, and perfects all things, and harmonizes the souls of living creatures, making them vigorous.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. 🤖 The choice of “gentle” reflects the implied Greek πραΰς, though “tranquil” is also possible depending on context.
2. 🤖 The word translated as “full of vapor” (“πνευματώδης”) can also mean “windy” or “spirituous”; in ancient cosmological texts, it often denotes an air quality laden with vapor or miasma, suggesting unhealthy or feverish conditions. Alternate translations could include “windy” or “rich in spirit,” but “full of vapor” is most appropriate here.
