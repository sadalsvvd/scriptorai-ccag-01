...they will be found swiftly; if in Taurus, within a year; if in Gemini, the escape will last twelve days; if in Cancer, within seven days; if in Leo, they will never return; if in Virgo, they will depart for seven days; if in Libra, they will return of their own accord; if in Scorpio, they will remain away for two years; if in Sagittarius, for three years; if in Capricorn, thenâ€”in the early degrees of the signâ€”they will be found quickly, but in the later degrees, they will remain for seven months; if in Aquarius, they will remain away for fifteen months; if in Pisces, for seven months.

Also observe the stars in the Ascendant: if Kronos (Saturn) is ascending, declare half the aforementioned time; if Ares (Mars), a third of the time; if Zeus (Jupiter), double the time; if Aphrodite (Venus), a long time; if Hermes (Mercury), complete escape is granted.

If Aries is at the Midheaven, the escape was without cause; if Taurus, on account of crimes; if Gemini, from mental anxiety; if Cancer, because they lost an important possession of their master; if Leo, they were persuaded by another; if Virgo, because of a reason or circumstance; if Libra, due to fear and being guarded; if Scorpio, because of reproach or shame; if Sagittarius, from desire for a courtesan; if Capricorn, from torture and fear; if Aquarius, from drunkenness; if Pisces, because of women.

The outcome of the setting is as follows:

If Aries sets with Mars, you will pay the penalty, but will be pardoned and escape again; if Taurus sets, they will be bound; if Gemini, they will be sold; if Cancer, through entreaty they will be released and will escape no more; if Leo, they will be endangered by wicked men or beasts; if Virgo, they will endanger themselves by their own actions; if Libra, fleeing repeatedly, they will fall into fire; if Scorpio, they will plot against themselves and become their own murderer; if Sagittarius, they will live profitably; if Capricorn, after a fall, they will be wounded; if Aquarius, they will live profitably; if Pisces, through women they will be restored.

Also observe the stars in the western sign: if Kronos (Saturn) sets, they carry nothing away; if Ares (Mars), they went out to death with iron; if Zeus (Jupiter) or Aphrodite (Venus), they carried away gold or silver or clothing; if Hermes (Mercury), they take bronze.

Next, regarding to which region the subterranean place leads and where they are likely to remain: if Aries is below the earth, they do not go far, but among the...

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1ðŸ¤– The Greek god names (Kronos, Ares, Zeus, Aphrodite, Hermes) are given at first mention with their Roman/astronomical equivalents in parentheses for clarity and to match scholarly convention.
2. ^1ðŸ¤– "Escape will last X days" and "they will remain away for X" are used to clarify that the duration refers to the time elapsed during absence or flight.
3. ^1ðŸ¤– "A reason or circumstance" in Virgo is a broader and more idiomatic rendering than the literal but awkward "a word or circumstance."
4. ^1ðŸ¤– "Courtesan" is used for Sagittarius, as a more neutral and historically accurate translation than "prostitute."
5. ^1ðŸ¤– The term "western sign" is chosen over "western zodiac" for astrological precision.
6. ^1ðŸ¤– "Below the earth" is retained in place of "underground," reflecting classical phrasing.
7. ^1ðŸ¤– Use of 'they/their' throughout increases inclusivity, conforming to modern standards, unless the historical context would strongly suggest a singular 'he.'
