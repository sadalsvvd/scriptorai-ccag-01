CODICES FLORENTINI — APPENDIX

For they share with each other even with respect to the terms^1🤖, which are, specifically, the divisions assigned to the five planets; for the Sun and the Moon do not have terms. For example, the ruler^2🤖 of Aries is Ares (Mars), since Aries is the house of Mars, and the co-ruler is Helios (the Sun), as Aries is also the exaltation and the triplicity (triangle)^3🤖 of the Sun. Again, the ruler of Taurus is Aphrodite (Venus), and the co-ruler is Selene (the Moon), not only by exaltation but also by triplicity. Of Gemini, the ruler is Hermes (Mercury); as for the co-ruler, by exaltation there is none, but by triplicity it is Kronos (Saturn), and by terms, all are included^4🤖. For Cancer, the ruler is Selene (the Moon), and the co-ruler is Ares (Mars) by terms and by triplicity. For Leo, the ruler is Helios (the Sun), the co-ruler by triplicity is Zeus (Jupiter), by terms, all, and by exaltation, Hermes (Mercury). For Virgo, the ruler is Hermes (Mercury); as for the co-rulers, by terms, all, and by triplicity, Aphrodite (Venus). For Libra, the ruler is Aphrodite (Venus), the co-ruler by triplicity alone is Hermes (Mercury), by both triplicity and exaltation it is Kronos (Saturn), and by terms, all. For Scorpio, the ruler is Ares (Mars); the co-ruler by triplicity is Selene (the Moon), by terms, all, by exaltation, none. For Sagittarius, the ruler is Zeus (Jupiter); by both exaltation and triplicity there is no co-ruler, but by terms, all. For Capricorn, the ruler is Kronos (Saturn); the co-ruler by exaltation is Ares (Mars), by terms, all, by triplicity, none. For Aquarius, the ruler is Kronos (Saturn); the co-ruler by triplicity is Hermes (Mercury), by terms, all, by exaltation, none.

These things being so, there are in all four kinds of rulership: house (domicile), exaltation, triplicity (triangle), and terms. The star that holds the greatest number of these rulerships in a given sign is said to be the ruler of that sign. But if each of two planets has two such rulerships in a sign, the one whose house (domicile) it is is called the ruler. For example, in Aries, the house is that of Mars, and he also has the terms therein; likewise, the Sun has both the exaltation and the triplicity in it, but Mars is the ruler because of the house. In Taurus, the house belongs to Aphrodite (Venus), and she also has the terms and the triplicity; the Moon has the exaltation and the triplicity, so Venus is more the ruler because she holds the majority^5🤖. In Gemini, Hermes (Mercury) has the house, terms, and triplicity; Kronos (Saturn) has only the triplicity, so Hermes is the ruler for this reason. In Cancer, the house and triplicity belong to the Moon, but Mars has the triplicity and the terms, so the Moon is the ruler because of the house. In Leo, the Sun has the house and triplicity, Zeus (Jupiter) has the terms and triplicity, but the Sun prevails as ruler. In Virgo, Hermes (Mercury) has the house, exaltation, and triplicity; Aphrodite (Venus) has the terms and triplicity, but Hermes is the ruler. In Libra, the house belongs to Aphrodite (Venus); Hermes (Mercury) and Kronos (Saturn) have the triplicity and exaltation, respectively.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term “terms” here translates the Greek "ὅρια," a technical term in Hellenistic astrology sometimes also rendered as "bounds." "Terms" is preferred by modern scholarship for clarity.

^2🤖 The word “ruler” translates Greek "οἰκοδεσπότης" or similar, literally "master of the house," but in astrological tradition "ruler" or "lord" of a sign is standard.

^3🤖 "Triplicity" (Greek "τρίγωνον," literally "triangle") refers to the set of three zodiac signs belonging to the same element, each with its own planetary ruler; sometimes called the "triplicity ruler" in astrology.

^4🤖 "All" (Greek "πάντες") in the context of terms means that, according to some systems, all five planets may have terms in given signs.

^5🤖 The phrase "so Venus is more the ruler because she holds the majority" (“κυριώτερος... διὰ τὸ πλεονάζειν”) indicates Venus is superior in rulership here because she holds more of the four types. Alternate renderings might be "because she predominates" or "by having the higher number."
