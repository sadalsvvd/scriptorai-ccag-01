CODICES FLORENTINI — APPENDIX

For they share with each other also according to the bounds, which are evidently the bounds of the five stars; for the Sun and the Moon do not have bounds. For example: the lord of Aries is Mars (Ares), for Aries is the house of Mars; the co-lord is the Sun (Helios), since Aries is the exaltation and the triangle of the Sun. Again, for Taurus the lord is Venus (Aphrodite), the co-lord is the Moon (Selene), not only according to the exaltation, but also according to the triangle. For Gemini the lord is Mercury (Hermes); but as co-lord, concerning the exaltation, there is none; concerning the triangle, it is Saturn (Kronos); and concerning the bounds, all (the planets). For Cancer the lord is the Moon, the co-lord is Mars (both) in bounds and in the triangle. For Leo the lord is the Sun, the co-lord according to the triangle is Jupiter (Zeus), according to the bounds all, according to the exaltation Mercury. For Virgo the lord is Mercury, and his co-lords, as to bounds, are all, but as to the triangle it is Venus. For Libra the lord is Venus, but as co-lord, solely as to the triangle it is Mercury; as to triangle and exaltation Saturn, as to the bounds all. For Scorpio the lord is Mars, as co-lord, as to the triangle, the Moon, as to the bounds all, as to the exaltation none. For Sagittarius the lord is Jupiter, as co-lord, neither as to the exaltation nor the triangle is there any, but as to the bounds all. For Capricorn the lord is Saturn, as co-lord, as to the exaltation Mars, as to the bounds all, as to the triangle none. For Aquarius the lord is Saturn, as co-lord, as to the triangle Mercury, as to the bounds all, as to the exaltation none.

Given these matters thus, there are four principles of lordship: house (oikos), exaltation (hypsoma), triangle (triplicity), and bounds (horia); the star that possesses the greater number of such principles in a given sign is said to be the lord of that sign. But if two of the stars each possess two principles in a certain sign, the one who has the house in the sign is called the lord. For instance, in Aries, the house is that of Mars, and he also has the bounds in it; likewise, the Sun has the exaltation and the triangle in it, but Mars is more lordly on account of the house. In Taurus, the house belongs to Venus, as well as the bounds and the triangle; the Moon has the exaltation and the triangle, so Venus is more lordly on account of possessing more. In Gemini, Mercury has the house as well as the bounds and the triangle, but Saturn only the triangle; so Mercury is more lordly for this reason. In Cancer, the Moon has the house and the triangle, while Mars has the triangle and the bounds, so the Moon is more lordly on account of the house. In Leo, the Sun has the house and the triangle, while Jupiter has the bounds and the triangle, but the Sun is more lordly. In Virgo, Mercury has the house, the exaltation and the triangle, while Venus has the bounds and the triangle, but Mercury is more lordly. In Libra, Venus has the house, Mercury and Saturn the triangle and exaltation, respectively.
