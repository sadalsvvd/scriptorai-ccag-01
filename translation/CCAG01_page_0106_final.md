If fate has determined it, it will come to pass, but slowly. Yet, when they are in declining signs, they are not effectual. But if they are found to be ambiguous, the matter will incline toward the more influential aspect. Therefore, whenever the benefics, together with the Moon and Hermes (Mercury), bear witnessâ€”namely, to the lord conducting and governing, as well as to the ruler of the hourâ€”the result will be favorable; but when the malefics and likewise the Moon and Hermes bear witness, the beginning will be inauspicious, and so the undertaking. If both parties pertain to the more influential, it will then be discerned whether the beginnings shall be lasting in this way. One must observe the horoscope and the Moonâ€”in which signs they are situated, their natures, and their placements, and further, their aspects and separations from the Moon, and whether they are steadfast toward those to whom they are directed. Additionally, one must pay attention to their conjunctions; thus will you know the quality of the beginning: for when the Moon and the horoscope are in tropical signs, they will quickly effect a change in the beginning, unless the Moon happens to be in mutual aspect; but if they chance to be in bicorporeal signs, it will produce duration but not permanence; if, however, in solid signs, the beginning is enduring; so also, if the Moon is in mutual aspect, the beginning is enduring, all the more so if she happens to be in a solid sign. One must also take into account the testimonies, aspects, and separations: for whenever the Moon inclines toward a steadfast star, she brings slowness; but in beginnings taking place in moveable signs, it will occur in squares, diameters (oppositions), conjunctions, or at the critical change.

F. 105 (221). 31. The Inception when Theodorus the Augustal Prefect Entered Alexandria.

He, having begun well and administered uprightly and being unblemished and truthful and having been confirmed by the city, was succeeded with outrage and damage as one accused of theft, in the 222nd year of Diocletian, in the month of Phamenoth, on the twenty-seventh day, on a lunar day, at the first hour: the Sun in the twenty-sixth degree of Pisces, the Moon in the twenty-seventh of Capricorn, Kronos (Saturn) in the eleventh of Sagittarius, Zeus (Jupiter) in the twenty-seventh of Leo, Ares (Mars) in the twenty-fifth of Aries, Aphrodite (Venus) in the twelfth of Pisces, Hermes (Mercury) in the twenty-seventh of Pisces, the horoscope in the twenty-seventh of Aries, the midheaven the tenth of Capricorn, the ascendant at thirty-two degrees of Sagittarius, the lower culmination at the twentieth of Virgo, the Lot of Fortune in the twenty-sixth of Aquarius. The planetary hour had Mars as the ruler and occupying his own throne, and being in trine to Jupiter and Saturn, and both Venus and the Lot of Fortune dwelling in the place of the Good Daimon (11th house), and the Moon at the midheaven.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ðŸ¤– "If fate has determined it": The original uses a passive construction implying something bound to happen by fateâ€”this renders the determinism of the Greek clearly and concisely.
^2ðŸ¤– "Incline toward the more influential aspect": The Greek refers to the predominance of one configuration over another; "aspect" is used here in the technical astrological sense.
^3ðŸ¤– "Bear witness": Rendering of ancient technical language for astrological testimony; adding parenthetical modern planetary names for clarity to modern readers.
^4ðŸ¤– "Mutual aspect": Translating the Greek term for planets being in aspect with each otherâ€”not only conjunction but also other significant angular relationships; this is a technical term in ancient astrology.
^5ðŸ¤– "Solid signs": This is equivalent to "fixed signs" in modern astrology; "tropical" = "cardinal," "bicorporeal" = "mutable."
^6ðŸ¤– "Ascendant at thirty-two degrees of Sagittarius": Degree designations above 30 are due to different ancient reckoning (sign plus degrees counted from preceding sign); modern calculation would normalize within 0â€“30 per sign.
^7ðŸ¤– "Place of the Good Daimon": Technical name for the 11th house from the Ascendant, considered a favorable house.
^8ðŸ¤– The emendation from ÎºÎµâ€™ (25th) to ÎºÎ¶â€™ (27th) is confirmed by the scholarly apparatus; the date corresponds to March 23rd, 487 A.D., as noted in the commentary.
