...when he meets with them, it will succeed, though slowly. But when they are in their declining phases, they will not succeed. If, however, they are found equally balanced, the matter will turn to whichever is the stronger disposition. Therefore, when the benefics and the Moon and Mercury bear witness for them—that is, for the ruler, the administrator, and the lord of the hour—the affair will result in success; but when the malefics and the Moon and Mercury bear witness, both the inception and the result are adverse. If both sides incline toward the stronger, it is necessary to ascertain whether the inceptions will be enduring in this way: one must observe the ascendant and the Moon—in what signs they are, their natures and positions, and also the aspects and separations of the Moon, and whether she is stable with respect to those to which she applies; furthermore, their configurations, and thus you will discern the quality of the inception. For if the Moon and the ascendant happen to be in the cardinal signs, a rapid change in the inception will occur, unless the Moon happens to be under a configuration; but if they are in the double-bodied signs, it will last for a time, but will not persist throughout; but if they are in the fixed signs, the inception is lasting. Likewise, if the Moon is under a configuration, the inception is lasting, and still more so if she happens to be in a fixed sign. One must also take into account the testimonies, aspects, or separations; for when the Moon applies to a steadfast star, it brings about slowness; and in those inceptions belonging to mutable configurations, such as quartile, opposition, conjunction, or change, such effects will arise.

F. 105 (221). 31. Inception: When Theodorus the Augustalis entered Alexandria.

He, having begun well and managed rightly and being unblemished and truthful and attested by the city, was succeeded with haste amid insult and loss as though he had stolen. In the year 222 of Diocletian, on the 25th of Phamenoth, on the day of the Moon, in the first hour: the Sun at 26° Pisces, the Moon at 27° Capricorn, Saturn at 11° Sagittarius, Jupiter at 27° Leo, Mars at 25° Aries, Venus at 12° Pisces, Mercury at 27° Pisces, the ascendant at 27° Aries, the midheaven at 10° Capricorn, the anabibazon at 32° Sagittarius, the katabibazon at 20° Virgo, the Lot of Fortune at 26° Aquarius. At the hour, Mars was ruling and enthroned, and was trined by Jupiter and Saturn, and Venus and the Lot of Fortune were in the good daimon, and the Moon was at the midheaven.
