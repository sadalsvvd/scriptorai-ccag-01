LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 I rendered "Φυσικὴ θεωρία περὶ τῶν γινομένων σεισμῶν ὡς οἱ παλαιοἰ" as "Natural inquiry concerning the occurrence of earthquakes according to the ancients." The Greek "θεωρία" can also mean "contemplation" or "theory"; "natural inquiry" has been preferred here as most neutral for ancient scientific writing, but "Natural theory" or "Physical contemplation" would also be valid alternatives. "According to the ancients" translates "ὡς οἱ παλαιοἰ," which could also be given as "in the manner of the ancients" or "as handed down by the ancients."
