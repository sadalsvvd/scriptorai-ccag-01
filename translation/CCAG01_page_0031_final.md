LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 *On Antanalysis*: The Greek term “ἀνταναλύσις” (antanalysis) is a technical term in late antique astrology. The parenthetical phrase appears fragmentary; it is likely a definition describing an astrological process involving “diurnal stars,” that is, stars associated with the daytime movement; context may clarify further.

^2🤖 *Retrograde Sun*: Whether “passing” or “retrograde” Sun is correct depends on the exact Greek term (e.g., ἀναποδίζων for "retrograde"); “retrograde” is used here as standard astrological terminology, but if the Greek is ambiguous, “passing” might be equally defensible.

^3🤖 *You were saved among all men*: The Greek “ἔρρυσο” is ambiguous—possibly “you were delivered,” “you perished,” or “you were rescued.” The choice “you were saved among all men” preserves this ambiguity; alternative nuances are possible depending on context.

^4🤖 *<i.—for those>*: The angle-bracketed text reflects an apparent manuscript lacuna or editorial uncertainty and is retained as in the original. The four “turnings” of the year refer to the solstitial and equinoctial points in astrological doctrine.
