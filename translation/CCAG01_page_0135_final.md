APPENDIX

The first [hour/degree/portion]^1🤖 is assigned to Ares (Mars), the second to Helios (the Sun), the third to Aphrodite (Venus), the fourth to Zeus (Jupiter), the fifth to Kronos (Saturn), the sixth to Selene (the Moon), the seventh to Hermes (Mercury), and again the eighth to Ares, and so on in succession. The horoscopic sign^2🤖 is determined as follows: beginning with the sign in which the Sun is found, they assign to each subsequent sign one hour in order, and whichever sign the final hour falls upon, that one is designated as the horoscopic sign. Wherever the presiding planet, in its course, directs the cosmic lot (tychē)^3🤖, there they set Kronos (Saturn); from that, in the sixth sign, they place Ares (Mars); from Ares, in the fourth, Aphrodite (Venus); from Aphrodite, in the second, Selene (the Moon); from Selene, in the seventh, Zeus (Jupiter); from Zeus, in the fifth, Helios (the Sun); from Helios, in the third, Hermes (Mercury). From these hypothetical arrangements, these allocations of places, and from the natures of the signs, they perform the mathematical (i.e., precise/technical) astrological analysis of inceptions (katarchai)^4🤖. They also observe both the combatant (poleyōn)^5🤖 and the presiding planet (diepōn)^5🤖, as chance may have it and as attested by whomever, and they do not state their judgments arbitrarily.

Let there also be an example of what has been said: Suppose the reckoning is made from the conjunction in Cancer, on day 147; I divide by 7, and 2 remain, so that Ares (Mars) is the combatant on that day. If the set hour is the fourth, then Zeus (Jupiter) is the presiding planet, and Helios (the Sun) is, cosmically, in Aquarius. Therefore, let the horoscopic sign for the fourth hour be Taurus. And since Zeus, the presider by progression, happens to be in Taurus, then Kronos (Saturn) will be in Taurus, Ares (Mars) in Libra, Aphrodite (Venus) in Capricorn, Selene (the Moon) in Aquarius, Zeus (Jupiter) in Leo, Helios (the Sun) in Sagittarius, and Hermes (Mercury) in Aquarius.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek term (e.g., “ὥρα”, “μοῖρα”) is ambiguous in astrological context, potentially meaning “hour,” “degree,” or “portion.” The translation retains this ambiguity for scholarly precision.
^2🤖 “Horoscopic sign” translates “horoscopon zōidion,” commonly known as “the ascendant” in astrology; see footnote for traditional terminology.
^3🤖 “Cosmic lot” renders Greek “tychē,” a technical term for one’s astrological fate, fortune, or lot.
^4🤖 “Inceptions (katarchai)” is a technical astrological term referring to beginnings or elections (the choosing of astrologically auspicious times).
^5🤖 “Combatant (poleyōn)” and “presiding planet (diepōn)” are technical roles in Hellenistic astrological practice, often rendered as “attacker” and “ruler/presider,” respectively.
