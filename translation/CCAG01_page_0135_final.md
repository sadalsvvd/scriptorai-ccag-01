the first [hour] to Ares, the second to Helios (the Sun), the third to Aphrodite, the fourth to Zeus, the fifth to Kronos, the sixth to Selene, the seventh to Hermes, and the eighth again to Ares, and so forth in order. They determine the ascendant (rising sign) as follows: beginning from the zodiacal sign in which Helios (the Sun) is located, to each [planet] they assign one hour in sequence, and the sign upon which the final hour falls they designate as the ascendant (rising sign). And wherever the ruler in succession determines the cosmic fortune, there they place Kronos for them; in the sixth sign from this, they place Ares; from Ares, the fourth is allotted to Aphrodite; from Aphrodite, the second to Selene; from Selene, the seventh to Zeus; from Zeus, the fifth to Helios; from Helios, the third to Hermes. From these arrangements, these local distinctions, and the nature of the zodiacal signs, they perform mathematical astrology concerning the inception (of events). They observe both the planet of strife and the ruler, however it may occur and by whomever they are witnessed, and they do not pronounce judgment without investigation.

Let there also be an example of what has been said: let it be reckoned from the conjunction on day 147 in Cancer¹; I divide by 7, 2 remain, so that Ares is determined as ruler of that day; and let the hour in question be the fourth, so that Zeus is determined as ruler, and Helios (the Sun), in terms of the cosmos, is in Aquarius. Thus, let the ascendant at the fourth hour be Taurus, and since Zeus, the ruler in succession, happens to be in Taurus, Kronos will be in Taurus, Ares in Libra, Aphrodite in Capricorn, Selene in Aquarius, Zeus in Leo, Helios in Sagittarius, and Hermes in Aquarius.
