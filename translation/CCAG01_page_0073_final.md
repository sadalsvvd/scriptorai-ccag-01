LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Effluxion” translates “ροήσεως,” which refers to processes of flowing or emission in physical and astrological contexts; in philosophy, it often has the sense of “outflow” or “emanation.”  
^2🤖 “Stars in potency” translates “τῶν ἐν δυνάμει ἀστέρων.” While “in potentiality” or “potential stars” is possible, “in potency” better reflects ancient technical language.

^4🤖 “Rejoice” is a technical term in traditional astrology indicating favorable planetary conditions.  
^5🤖 “Subradiant” translates “ὑπαύγων,” attempting to express “under-shining” or “less fully radiant”; no direct English equivalent exists.  
^6🤖 “Lots of significance” translates “κλήρων σημασίας”; “lots” refer to astrological points calculated mathematically to signify topics in a chart.  
^7🤖 “Satellites of the Sun” renders “δορυφοριῶν τοῦ Ἡλίου”; in ancient astrology, this refers to "bodyguard" planets in specific configurations relative to the Sun.  
^8🤖 “Superintendence” renders “προστηρία,” a rare Greek word denoting governance, presidency, or oversight; alternatives include “presiding influence” or “guardianship.”  
^11🤖 “Added by later hand: Ptolemy” denotes a marginal or interlinear attribution by a scribe, likely referencing a 15th-century addition.  
^12🤖 “Climates” refers to “κλίματα,” meaning geographical bands (parallels) in ancient geoclimatic and astrological science.
