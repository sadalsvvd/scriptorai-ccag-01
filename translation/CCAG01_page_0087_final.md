...Ptolemy himself completed an account concerning them. Yet none of the aforementioned men transferred either the present epochs from their astronomical calculation, nor the compositional nature of their mixture.^1🤖

                                                                                              [F. C.]

From the book of Lydus On Portents (written c. AD 560).

Chapter 2. Now I think it is fitting for anyone who wishes to write on such matters to explain whence also the apprehension of these things began, and to state from where it derived its starting points, and in what way it so progressed, as even—if it be permitted to say—to surpass even the Egyptians themselves. For of these, after Zoroaster among many others, Petosiris, in his specialized works, after interweaving many things in general, strives to deliver much according to his own teaching, yet he does not deliver these to all, but only to those belonging to him, or rather, to as many of them as are more apt for conjecture.^2🤖 Antigonus, after him, both distinguished and articulated the tradition, yet, deviating towards the density of the lines in astronomy, associated uninitiated crowds full of all sorts of obscurity with the text. For the things said by Aristotle are most well-known. Heliodorus and Ascletion, and also Odapsos the Theban and the Aegaean, Pollas, and that most revered Ptolemy before them, none of them succeeded in wholly expelling the ancient obscurity of the subject, despite having very earnestly endeavored to do this.

                                                                                              [F. C.]

Afterwards, Lydus speaks about Tages, Tarchon, and Tarquitius, the sacred interpreters of Etruscan discipline, and about other Latin authors.

Ed. Wachsmuth (1897), p. 6. 5 εἰδικοῖς (Casaubonus). γενικὰ συμπλέξας conjecture of Kroll. 12 For Asclation Hase has hesitantly proposed Ascletarion; on this cf. Suetonius, Domitian, ch. 15, but cf. above, Valens, v. 19. Wachsmuth has written Ὠδαψός for Δαψός following Hephaestion. καὶ ὁ Αἰγιεύς supplemented by Wachsmuth from Suidas.

From the apotelesmatic book of Masala (AD 770–820?)¹.

Discourse of the most learned Masala, containing the number of books which each of the ancient sages wrote, and the powers of the books.

Masala said: “I observed that the ancient sages had doubts regarding certain astronomical hypotheses, of which a multitude of sages has arisen from these books; and on account of this, confusion occurs in the mind of the one reading these things. But I have set forth such a book, summarily indicating in it the things that are not doubtful and the more excellent among the accounts, both from the books...

^1🤖 The rendering of “οὐδεὶς... μετήγαγεν ἐκ τοῦ ἀστρονομουμένου τὰς νῦν αὐτῶν οὔσας ἐποχὰς οὐδὲ τὸ ποιητικὸν τῆς κράσεως αὐτῶν” is interpretative. The Greek is highly compressed and may also mean: “none... transferred the present epochs, or the creative (i.e., originating) principle of their composition, from what is astronomically calculated.” The phrase “compositional nature of their mixture” attempts to capture “τὸ ποιητικὸν τῆς κράσεως,” which refers to their formative essence in a technical or astrological sense.

^2🤖 On Petosiris: “strives to deliver much according to his own teaching, yet he does not deliver these to all, but only to those belonging to him, or rather, to as many of them as are more apt for conjecture,” as the Greek suggests an esoteric tradition, with teachings reserved for select disciples, particularly those with strong abilities in inference or conjecture.
