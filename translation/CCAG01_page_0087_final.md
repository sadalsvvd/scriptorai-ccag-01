...Ptolemy himself, having thus attained such a state, completed the work concerning them. But none of the aforementioned men transferred to them the epochs which are now assigned based on astronomical calculation, nor the manner of the composition of their mixture.

From the book of Lydus on Omens (written ca. 560 CE).

Chapter 2. And I think it fitting, for anyone wishing to write on such matters, to explain both whence the understanding of such things began, and from where it took its starting-points, and how it so far advanced that—if it is right to say so—they even surpassed the Egyptians themselves. For of these, after the many Zoroasters, Petosiris, in his specialized writings, having woven together many details, strives to hand down much according to his own teaching, but does not hand these down to all, only to those of his school, or rather to those among them better suited for conjecture. Antigonus, after him, distinguished and arranged the transmission, yet, deviating towards the density of the lines written in astronomy, he composed his writing for an uninitiated crowd full of all manner of obscurity. For what was said by Aristotle is exceedingly well-known. Heliodorus and Ascletion, and also Odapsos the Theban and the Aegean, Pollas, and that most divine of those before them, Ptolemy, were not able, to the end, to cast out the ancient obscurity of the matter, although, to be sure, they earnestly strove to do even this.

                                                             [F. C.]

Next, Lydus speaks about Tages, Tarchon, Tarquitius—interpreters of the sacred discipline of the Etruscans—and about other Latin writers.

Ed. Wachsmuth (1897), p. 6. 5 For εἰδικοῖς (“to the specialized”) Casaubonus. γενικά συμπλέξας (“having intertwined things in general”) conjectured by Kroll. 12 For Ἀσκλητίωνα (Asclation), Hase has suggested, with hesitation, Ἀσκλεταρίωνα (Ascletarion); concerning whom see Suetonius, Domitian, ch. 15. But see above, Valens v. 19. Wachsmuth wrote Ὠδαψός (Odapsos) for Δαψός (Dapsos), following Hephaestion. “And the Aegean” added by Wachsmuth from Suidas.

From the apotelesmatic book of Masala (770–820? CE)¹.

Discourse of the most wise Masala, containing the number of books which each of the ancient sages authored, and the powers of the books.

Masala said that he saw the ancient sages harboring doubts concerning certain astronomical hypotheses, of which there became a multitude of sages
