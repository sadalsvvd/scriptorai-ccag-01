LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ü§ñ The Greek "Œ∫œÅ·æ∂œÉŒπœÇ" can be translated as "mixture" or "temperament," referring to the blending of fundamental qualities in astrological signs.

^2ü§ñ The Greek terms refer to ancient dermatological categories: "leprous" (leprosy), "alphous" (a lighter skin disease, possibly vitiligo or a similar condition), "mange-producing" (related to scabies or mange), and "lichenoid" (referring to lichen-like skin eruptions). The mapping to modern medical terminology is uncertain and debated.

^3ü§ñ The Greek adjective may denote either "unproductive," "uncontrolled," or "licentious." The precise meaning may have differed in ancient astrological or medical context.

^4ü§ñ "Doryphory" is a technical Hellenistic astrological term denoting a bodyguard configuration, where certain planets "attend" or "guard" a significator. The Greek term is sometimes left untranslated.
