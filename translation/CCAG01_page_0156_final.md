These matters were very well expounded by Teucer the Babylonian; but we will briefly recall them as follows.

It must be known that each zodiacal sign has three decans, and each decan has been allotted ten degrees. In each degree, the Sun completes twenty-one hours, that is, one full night-and-day cycle.

In the first decan of Aries, it brings about dangers, plots, and flows; in the second, wealth and renown, but with swift death; in the third, illnesses, disturbances, hardship in youth, but cheerfulness in old age.

In the first decan of Taurus, it makes the native wealthy and distinguished from foreign sources; in the second, it makes youth wretched, but dangers are quickly escaped; in the third, it produces soldiers, providers of plenty, stability, sociability, and longevity.

In the first decan of Gemini, the man who marries will not be successful, will not be diligent, and will grieve over children; in the second, he will have a marriage not fit for him, but it signifies cheerfulness among soldiers; in the third, it produces wealthy and renowned people, rulers, but with swift death.

In the first decan of Cancer, it produces public officials, and grief will be experienced over children; they are very sorrowful in youth, but most fortunate in old age; in the second, the married man will prosper and benefit from the affairs of others, but will be pained because of a wife; in the third, the one born will be fortunate and greatly sorrowful in youth, but will rejoice in old age.

In the first decan of Leo, it produces rulers and wealthy men, and in the end, there is prosperity and a wife will be acquired; in the second and third, it produces baseness and brings about wretchedness, and destroys those who go abroad.

In the first decan of Virgo, it brings dangers, and those born will soon become orphans; in the second and third, it produces fortunate people and they will become wealthy from associations with women, but they will grieve over parents and children.

In the first decan of Libra, the native will be in danger in youth, but later will acquire wealth by means of underground things or discoveries; in the second, he will prosper from livestock, though with swift death; in the third, he will encounter illnesses and disturbances in youth, but in old age will rejoice in many ways.

In the first decan of Scorpio, he will benefit from Hermetic matters^1ü§ñ and will come to inherit manifestly distinguished things; in the second, he will endure dangers in various circumstances.

1. ^1ü§ñ "Hermetic matters" translates ·ºôœÅŒºŒ±œäŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ, which could refer to possessions or resources pertaining to Hermes‚Äîthus, possibly commerce, eloquence, travel, or even inherited goods or messages. Alternate renderings may specify "matters relating to Hermes" or "Hermetic matters." The ambiguity is retained due to potential technical astrological meanings.
