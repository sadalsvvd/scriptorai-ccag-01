These matters were excellently expounded by Teucer of Babylon; but we will give a brief summary as follows.

It must be known that in each zodiacal sign there are three decans; and each decan is allotted ten degrees; and in each degree the Sun completes twenty-one hours, that is, a single day and night.

In the first decan of Aries, it causes dangers, plots, and flows; but in the second, it produces the rich and illustrious, except that they die swiftly; but in the third, diseases, disturbances, affliction in youth, but in old age, joy.

In the first decan of Taurus, it makes the one born from outsiders wealthy and distinguished; but in the second, it makes youth miserable, though dangers are quickly escaped; but in the third, it creates soldiers, men of means, steadfast, communal, and long-lived.

In the first decan of Gemini, the one marrying will not be fortunate, will not be active, and will grieve over children; in the second, he will have an unsuitable marriage, but it signifies the joy of soldiers; and in the third, it produces the rich, illustrious, rulers, except that they die swiftly.

In the first decan of Cancer, it produces public officials, and they will grieve over children, being very sorrowful in youth, but in old age most fortunate; but in the second, the one marrying will prosper and benefit from matters arising from outsiders, and will be grieved by his wife; in the third, the one born is fortunate and very sorrowful in youth, but in old age will rejoice.

In the first decan of Leo, it produces rulers and the wealthy, and in the end he will be prosperous and will obtain a wife; but in the second and third, it brings baseness and misery, and destroys the one sojourning abroad.

In the first decan of Virgo, it brings dangers, and those born will quickly become orphans; but in the second and third, it makes them fortunate, and through unions with women they will become wealthy, except that they will be grieved over parents and children.

In the first decan of Libra, the one born will be endangered in youth, but later will acquire by means of what is subterranean or by discoveries; but in the second, he will become wealthy through quadrupeds, except that he dies swiftly; and in the third, he will undergo diseases and disturbances in youth, but in old age will rejoice by many means.

In the first decan of Scorpio, he will benefit from Hermetic matters and will inherit, and distinguished achievements will appear; but in the second, he will undergo dangers in circumstances.
