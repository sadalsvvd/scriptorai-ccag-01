...has done this? Also consider whether the phases of the stars are rising or setting, and in this way describe the corrupting influencesâ€”whether they are exalted or low in fortune.^1ðŸ¤– If Zeus is found lord of the Lot of Marriage and is potent, the person who has done this will be of noble lineage and will be wealthy or renowned. If Aphrodite is found ruler of the Lot of Marriage, and is found in the western pivot,^2ðŸ¤– it indicates that this has occurred through deception and laughter;^3ðŸ¤– but if Mars also beholds it, the person who has done this comes into trial on account of the attempt. If the Lot of Marriage happens to be where <Aphrodite> is as Hermes is ascending (horoscopos) or is at the angular point in a masculine sign, it produces pederasts; and if Hermes also beholds the Lot of Marriage, it does the same. And if Hermes, beholding the Lot, happens to be in a masculine sign, he will direct relations toward males. But if Hermes, watching the Lot of Marriage, is found in a feminine sign, he will have sexual relations with women contrary to nature. If you find the ruler of the Lot of Siblings at the Ascendant, say that such a person is an only child. If the lord of the Lot of Siblings falls in a double-bodied sign,^4ðŸ¤– say that such a person has siblings from another father or another mother; and, as I think, if both the Lot and its lord fall in a feminine sign, say the sibling is from another mother; but if in a masculine sign, from another father. If the Lot of Fortune falls in a masculine sign, it refers to the father; but in a feminine sign, to the mother, as Dorotheus says.^5ðŸ¤– If Kronos (Saturn) is first to cast a ray to the father's Lot, either by aspect or by bodily conjunction, or first beholds the father's Lot, he refers it to the father; and if likewise he beholds the mother's Lot, he refers it to the mother. If a malefic beholds the Lot of the father or of the mother, he refers it to that one.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ðŸ¤– In Hellenistic astrology, "rising or setting" refers to whether a planet is making its heliacal rise or setting, often regarded as "phases." "Exalted or low in fortune" translates the technical terms for dignified or weakened planetary status.

^2ðŸ¤– The "western pivot" refers to the western angle or Descendant (7th place) in the astrological chart.

^3ðŸ¤– The original phrase "through deception and laughter" may also imply mockery, levity, or sexual playfulness; "laughter" is a direct translation.

^4ðŸ¤– "Double-bodied sign" refers to the mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces), which are associated in Hellenistic astrology with duality and thus with half-siblings.

^5ðŸ¤– Dorotheus of Sidon was a major Hellenistic astrologer; this comment indicates that the doctrine being explained follows his teaching.
