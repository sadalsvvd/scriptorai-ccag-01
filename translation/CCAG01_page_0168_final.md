...has done this; but also consider the phases of the stars—whether they are rising or setting—and so speak of those who cause corruption, whether they are high or low in fortune. If Zeus is found to be lord of the Lot of Marriage and is rising, the one who has done this will be of noble birth and will be wealthy or renowned. If Aphrodite is found to be ruler of the Lot of Marriage and is found in the western angle, it indicates that this has come about through deceit and amusement; and if Mars also observes, the one who has done this comes into judgment because of the act. If the Lot of Marriage happens to be where <Aphrodite> is with Hermes at the ascendant <or> at the midheaven in a masculine sign, it produces pederasts*; and if Hermes also observes the Lot of Marriage, it does the same; and if Hermes, observing the Lot, is in a masculine sign, he will cause unions with males, but if Hermes is observing the Lot of Marriage in a feminine sign, he will have unnatural relations with women.

If you find the ruler of the Lot of Siblings in the ascendant, say such a one is an only child. If the lord of the Lot of Siblings falls in a double-bodied sign, say that such a person has siblings from another father or another mother; as I suppose, if the Lot and its ruler fall in a feminine sign, say the sibling is from another mother; but if in a masculine sign, from another father. If the Lot of Fortune falls in a masculine sign, it indicates the father; but in a feminine sign, the mother, as Dorotheus [says]. If, over the Lot of the Father, Saturn first casts a ray or first observes the Lot of the Father either by aspect or by interpolation, he indicates the father; but likewise, if he observes the Lot of the Mother, he indicates the mother. If a malefic observes the Lot of the Father or the Mother, take that one.
