^2ðŸ¤– "Fishes" refers to the zodiac sign Pisces. Parenthetical guides against concealment when the Moon is in Pisces.
^3ðŸ¤– "Wandering [stars]" is a traditional term for the planets, while modern English would simply say "the five planets."
^4ðŸ¤– "When culminating" means when a celestial body is at its highest point (midheaven), a significant astrological indicator.
^5ðŸ¤– "PsÄ“risos" is preserved in transliteration as a proper name. The number in brackets reflects the Greek numeral in the manuscript.
