LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 For “in front seven and behind seven,” the Greek reads literally; the meaning may refer to organization or divisions but is preserved for scholarly accuracy.  
^2🤖 ὁ καρπός is transliterated as *Karpos*; traditionally rendered as *The Fruit* or *Centiloquium* (a collection of one hundred astrological aphorisms often attributed to Ptolemy).  
^3🤖 “Prediction is understood in two ways…” uses “prediction” rather than “prognosis” for clearer meaning in astrological context; “occur at twenty-one” may also be rendered “on the twenty-first” depending on the original numbering.  
^4🤖 The phrase “the Moon ascends northward from the degree of the wind, square, with a numerical note” preserves the technical language of the manuscript. The exact astrological or mathematical implication is ambiguous, hence the literal rendering.
