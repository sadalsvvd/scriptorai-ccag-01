Babylon, and from such inquiry to foretell matters concerning wars,  
droughts, rainfall, kings, and every kind of affliction and misfortune prevailing throughout all lands—thus, therefore, I have judged  
this practice to be both proper and wisely conceived: to set up a genethlialogical chart (i.e., a mundane one)  
for the whole inhabited world, taking as its origin the reigning city as from the pivot of the  
universal theater, and, after establishing the horoscope, to treat everything as if for the nativity,  
through the testimonies of the benefic and malefic planets, and through the  
positions of the luminaries. However, in that which concerns the king, it is permitted for us to take from  
the royal lot and the position of its trigon lords,  
and from the degree culminating at the midheaven, and from the trigon lords of the  
midheaven and their positions, together with those of Jupiter.  
Then likewise, matters concerning enemies from the position of Mars, and those concerning  
the greatest misfortunes from Saturn, making use of the composite and natural  
succession of the signs and the stars, and the authority of the year's rulers,  
together with the prior first conjunction or synod or full moon of the year.  
The most general and universal revolution of the year takes place when the Sun enters Aries,  
while the most particular and partial is the one individually determined,  
which the wise Ptolemy spoke of, either from the other ingresses—namely,  
those of summer, autumn, and winter—and their preceding  
conjunctions; or an even more detailed and monthly transition,  
from the Sun’s entrance into each individual sign, and the associated  
horoscopic position and the focalization^1🤖 at that time, and the prior conjunction of the luminaries  
and the house-star governing it.  
These, then, are to be examined with respect to the yearly revolution, and accordingly  
the following matters as well; then in this way consider the outcomes, as we have set forth.

3 rursus inc. B: and therefore I have judged this practice to be proper, to set up a mundane genethlialogical chart, etc.

So, when these matters have been discussed, in what follows we shall investigate  
the results; accordingly, etc. B, continuing with what is introduced after the heading: results of the annual revolution  
as I have gathered from the ancients.

F. 65. On rains: a reputable doctrine from the saying of a certain Syrian¹.

It is necessary to understand concerning each occurrence of rainfall from the  
rulers of the year and from those of Venus and Hermes  
and the Moon.

¹ [The certain Syrian to whom this fragment is attributed is without doubt the same as the Syrian elsewhere.]

^1🤖 The term rendered "focalization" here corresponds to a technical astrological notion, sometimes translated as "centering" or "kentrōsis" (κεντρώσις) in the Greek. It refers to the focal or angular significance in the horoscope at the time of the Sun’s ingress, lacking an exact English equivalent. Alternate renderings might include "angular point" or "strong placement."
