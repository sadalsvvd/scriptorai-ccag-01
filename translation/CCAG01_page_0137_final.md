APPENDIX

Babylon, and from such a treatise to predict matters concerning wars, and droughts, and rains, and kings, and every misfortune happening throughout all lands, therefore I have judged that this is fitting and wisely conceived—to cast a nativity, that is, a mundane one—for the whole inhabited world, from the ruling city as from the foundation of the cosmic theater, and, after establishing the horoscope, to investigate everything as for a birth, through the indications both of benefics and malefics and of the positions of the luminaries; only as concerns the king, it is permitted for us to take from the royal lot and the positions of its triangular rulers, and from the culminating degree and the triangular rulers of the culmination, and their positions, and together with them, that of Jupiter; then, likewise, matters concerning enemies from the position of Mars, but those concerning the greatest crises from Saturn, using the systematic and natural sequence of the signs and stars and the rule of the lords of the year, together with the prior first conjunction of the year, that is, of the synod or the full moon.

And the most general and universal revolution of the year is that which takes place in Aries, but the most particular and partial one is that which is recognized for a part—which the wise Ptolemy stated—either from the remaining ingresses, that is, the summer and autumn and winter ingresses, and also those conjunctions that precede them; or the more detailed, monthly transition, from the Sun’s passage into each individual sign, and the horoscope and centration for that, and the prior conjunction of the luminaries which precedes it, and the star ruling it. On these things, therefore, let us deliberate concerning the annual revolution and what follows, and then thus examine the outcomes as we have laid out.

F. 65. On rains, an established doctrine from the saying of a certain Syrian¹.

It is necessary to know concerning the rain which is happening at any given time, from the lords of the year and from that of Venus and Hermes and the Moon.
