LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 In the phrase "except slowly" (πλὴν βραδέως), the original Greek may imply "except with delay" or "unless delayed"; the idiom may mean "with caution" or "except after some time."  
^2🤖 The phrase "evening stars are female" (ἐσπέριοι θήλυ): In Hellenistic astrology, planets or the lord of the horoscope positioned as evening stars were considered feminine.  
^3🤖 The text for "when someone is born (?)" is uncertain or corrupt; the manuscript context may be abbreviated or problematic.  
^4🤖 The Greek word "σκοποί" can refer to "guards," "lookouts," "observers," or "prospectors"; given the astrological context, both "guard" and "prospector" are plausible renderings.  
^5🤖 The Greek has ambiguity in number; "treasure" could also be read as "treasures."  
^6🤖 The phrase "thirty-one" likely refers to an enumerated procedure or step in a preceding sequence.
