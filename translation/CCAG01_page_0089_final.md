APPENDIX

From the Apotelesmatic book of Apomasar († 885 CE).^1

Here, unless I am mistaken, we have a fragment of a catalogue of prohibited books from the Byzantine era, specifically of books preserved in the library of the Capitolian palace (cf. Richter, Quellen der byz. Kunstgesch., 1897, p. 411). It is scarcely plausible this refers to the library of the Caliphs at Baghdad, since that Apotelesmatic miscellany which bears the name Apomasar was certainly at least in part collected later among the Greeks. Indeed, if one were to believe this book, Apomasar would, with marvelous foresight of future events, have anticipated the names of astrologers who wrote after his own death. Thus, from the codices which were extant in the palace at Constantinople, certain ones (the “common books,” τὰ κοινά) were lent to anyone who asked, while others (the “prohibited books,” τὰ κωλυόμενα) could not be read, and from the catalogue of these works a certain diviner of that time excerpted those titles which pertained to his discipline. The exact date cannot be determined, and while several works are said to have been published through Apomasar’s interpreter, it is best to refrain from conjecture. Nevertheless, the upper and lower limits are the tenth century, in which Isaac ben Solomon lived, and the year 1388, in which the Angelicanus codex was written. — It is remarkable, if this is indeed the case, how many works translated from Eastern languages, or at least attributed to Eastern writers, were in the imperial palace, and it is possible that this index relates to some Arabic library in which the writings of Stephanus of Alexandria, Pseudo-Aristotle, Palchus, Hermes, and Valens, translated from Greek, were kept together with books in the vernacular. To those names which were already known to us from other sources, we have appended a note, so as to contribute at least somewhat to a correct evaluation of the oldest catalogues of codices. We certainly commend this matter to those more experienced in Semitic literature.

On mathematical books formerly preserved in the palace and not lent out.

The same [i.e., Apomasar] said that the Apotelesmatic books which are preserved in the palace and not lent to anyone for reading but are prohibited are these:  
The Apotelesmatic^2🤖 of Stephanus of Alexandria.^2  
[That] of Aristotle.^3  
[That] of Theophilus, son of Thomas.^4

From Codex Angelicus 29, year 1388, folio 52, chapter οςʹ (= A). The same excerpt, although mutilated, is also found in Codex Vaticanus 1506, 14th century, folio 204v (V), as discovered by F. Boll, who kindly sent me his transcript. — Folio 52 of Codex A, partly decayed at the edge, was repaired by a binder with a new leaf, onto which the words that had already vanished from sight were transcribed. 1–2 βιβλίων … διδομένων A second hand. 3–4 βιβλία … διδομένα A second hand. 4–5 κωλυομένων νυν (sic) … ἀποτελεσματικόν A second hand. 6 τοῦ ἀλεξάνδρου τοῦ ἀπ. τοῦ στεφάνου AV.

[From this Pseudo-Aristotelian book, many fragments translated from Arabic into Latin have been preserved in the book published by Peter Lichtenstein, entitled Iudicum in indicibus astrorum novem liber, Basel 1571, printed together with Albohazen and separately published — F.B.]  
^4 A fragment of Theophilus of Edessa, son of Thomas, will be edited below from codex 12, folio 56r, where information about the author will also be found.

^2🤖 The term “Apotelesmatic” (Greek ἀποτελεσματικόν) is a technical term referring to works of astrological prognostication or outcomes. It is left untranslated here for accuracy. Alternate renderings include “Book of Effects” or “On Outcomes,” but the conventional transliteration is preferred.
