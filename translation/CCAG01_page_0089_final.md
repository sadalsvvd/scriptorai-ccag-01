APPENDIX

From the apotelesmatic book of Apomasar († 885 CE)¹.

Here, if I am not mistaken, we have a fragment of an index of prohibited books from the Byzantine era, namely of books preserved in the library of the Capitoline palace (cf. Richter, Quellen der byz. Kunstgesch., 1897, p. 411). It is scarcely conceivable that the library in question is that of the Caliphs of Baghdad, for this apotelesmatic compilation, which bears the name of Apomasar, was certainly in part assembled later among the Greeks. Indeed, if this book were to be trusted, Apomasar, by marvelous divination of future events, would have foreseen the names of astrologers who wrote after his death. Thus, from the codices that existed in the imperial palace at Constantinople, some (the “common” ones, τὰ κοινά) were lent to anyone who requested them, while others (the “prohibited” ones, τὰ κωλυόμενα) could not be read; and from the catalogue of these works, a certain soothsayer of that time excerpted the titles relevant to his discipline. The precise date of this activity cannot be defined, and since more works “from Apomasar,” so it is said, have been published in translation, it is preferable to refrain from conjectures. However, the outer limits are the tenth century, when Isaac ben Solomon lived, and the year 1388, when the Angelicanus codex was copied. — Nevertheless, if matters are thus, it is remarkable how many works translated from Eastern languages, or at least attributed to Oriental writers, were kept in the emperors’ palace, and it is possible that this index pertains to some Arabic library in which the writings of Stephanus of Alexandria, Pseudo-Aristotle, Palchus, Hermes, and Valens, translated from Greek, were kept together with vernacular books. To names already known to us from other sources, we have added a note, in order to contribute at least something to the accurate assessment of the oldest catalogues of books. We certainly commend this to those more skilled in Semitic letters.

On the books on mathematics, once stored in the palace and not lent out. The same (i.e. Apomasar) said that the apotelesmatic books stored in the palace and not lent to anyone for reading, but rather prohibited, are these:
The Apotelesmatic Book of Stephanus of Alexandria², of Aristotle³, and of Theophilus, son of Thomas⁴.

From codex Angelicus 29, year 1388, folio 52, chapter οςʹ (= A). The same excerpt, though mutilated, is found in codex Vaticanus 1506, 14th century, folio 204v (V), as found by F. Boll, who kindly sent me his transcript. — Folio 52 of codex A, eaten away at the outer edge and mended with new paper, on which the words already lost to sight were transcribed, was restored by the bookbinder. 1–2 βιβλίων ... διδομένων A hand 2. 3–4 βιβλία ... διδομένα A hand 2. 4–5 κωλυομένων νυν (sic) ... ἀποτελεσματικὸν A hand 2. 6 τοῦ ἀλεξάνδρου τοῦ ἀπ. τοῦ στεφάνου AV.
