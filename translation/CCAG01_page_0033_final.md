LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Unipartite degree” translates a Greek term sometimes rendered as “unidegree”; “unipartite degree” is preferred here for technical precision. Alternative: “unidegree.”

^2🤖 “Prooimion” is retained from the Greek προοίμιον, denoting a scholarly preface or introduction. An alternative rendering would be “preface” or “proem,” but “prooimion” is standard in academic treatments of ancient scientific texts, especially to preserve technical connotations. “Thema,” likewise, is a technical term referring to the whole astrological configuration at birth.
