LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek "ἐνί μεσάτοισι χρόνοις" can mean "in the midst of times," "seasons," or "periods." Here, "times" is used to preserve the temporal ambiguity of the original.

^2🤖 The Greek text is fragmentary here and lacks a main verb or predicate; this incomplete clause is retained to reflect its lacunose state.

^3🤖 The phrase "λήγουσα δὲ μεῖον ἐλαύνει" is ambiguous. It may mean "and by moving (or pausing) less, she sets (ends) more slowly," i.e., she brings about a slower ending. "Moving less" is interpretative. Alternate renderings are possible.
