…some stars follow him either in their own place, or if the Moon casts its dodecatemorion^1🤖. If the Moon falls beneath the earth, he will be found with difficulty, and all the more so if [it is] in Gemini, or in Leo, or in Libra, or in Pisces; but if Zeus observes^2🤖, he will be found swiftly. But if Kronos or Ares [is observing], his life will be in danger, or he will perish by his own hand; and if this occurs at the ascendant^4🤖, he will be found upon being denounced. But if at the midheaven^4🤖, he will be found in a public and much-frequented place; but if beneath the earth, he will be found with difficulty upon denunciation. Whenever someone begins to travel halfway along the road, he will be apprehended at the start of the journey; whenever someone travels toward the west, he will be apprehended at the same time in a damp place; whenever someone travels toward the north, he will be apprehended with difficulty. If any of the stars is in its own house, or if the Moon is in a tropical sign, it indicates that he has not escaped. If the fugitive carries off money and Ares observes the ascendant or the Moon, he will squander the money in prodigality. But if Aphrodite is together with Ares, [he will spend it] on debauchery and the desires for women and for the sake of ** [lacuna]. If Zeus shines upon the ascendant and is observed by Kronos, whatever he has carried off he will lose, but he himself at least will be saved.

Let us also make use of a certain such method of prediction. Let us make the Moon the fugitive, and the midheaven the master. Therefore, if at the beginning of the flight the Moon is waning, and not far from full, quickly the fugitive will return home; and if the master, in some disposition or by himself ***, then thus his wrongdoing will be hidden from him. But if the Moon is waxing, the fugitive will not escape, and quickly will come into the power of the master. If the Sun sets and is afflicted^6🤖 by Kronos or Ares, the master will die sooner and the fugitive will be taken up. In the same way, observe also the midheaven; and if the malefics^5🤖 happen to be upon it, they will cause greater loss and harm to the master seeking [his property], rather than any benefit being found.
