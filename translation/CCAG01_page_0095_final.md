and to exceed it; but beyond this, there could be neither deficiency nor excess. And Abdolrahman al-Khazin, who composed the precise and sound compilation of Sanzari, established the course of the stars up to this year. Now, the beginning of this year was the seventh day, the twenty-eighth of Kayāk, which is the third month according to the months of Nebuchadnezzar^1🤖; from this, the years are counted from [Nebuchadnezzar] up to this, the fourth year; and from Alexander the Macedonian up to this point there are 940 years.

The fifth year is reckoned from the time of Yasyandzar, son of Sahir, son of Mestreh^2🤖, who reigned later than the other kings; the years of this reckoning are maintained by the fire-worshippers. The beginning of that year is the third day; and that day is the beginning of Farvardīn; and the beginning of the year is the nineteenth of the month Kaykhāki. Thus, the years from Nebuchadnezzar up to this time, and from Alexander the Macedonian, there are 950 years; and from Dhu’l-Qarnain, from the nineteenth day of Haziran, there are 943 years up to this point. And thus, on the twenty-second of the month Rabiʿ al-Awwal, according to the reckoning of the Hijra (the year of Muhammad), it is year 11.

The author of the compilation completed by Kasyari in this year was named Ali son of Abd al-Karim; he also compiled the treatise of Alāʾ in this year. Khusam Salar set down the compilation of Isah in this year, and the compilation of Fakhr in this year, and the compilation of Athratin was produced in this year; and the compilation of Makhkī the Matritan was also produced in this year, and likewise the compilation of Khonjanasyr was set down in this year; and many other compilations were produced in this year. Why? Because this year, more than the others, is easier to comprehend.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase “third month according to the months of Nebuchadnezzar” reflects the original Greek’s unusual formulation. It indicates that Kayāk is counted as the third month in a calendar reckoning attributed to Nebuchadnezzar. Alternate: “the third month in the reckoning of Nebuchadnezzar.”

^2🤖 “Yasyandzar, son of Sahir, son of Mestreh” is a literal transliteration from the Greek; these names are traditionally identified as Yazdegerd III, son of Shahriyar (or Shahryar), son of Khosrow, the last Sassanian king of Persia.
