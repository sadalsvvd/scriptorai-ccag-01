2. On the Selection of the Planets.

In diurnal nativities, the rulers of the sect are the Sun, Saturn, and Jupiter; in nocturnal nativities, the Moon, Venus, and Mars. For Hermes (Mercury)^1🤖 stands as common to both sects. Of the planets, those considered benefic are the Sun, Jupiter, Moon, and Venus; the malefic are Saturn and Mars. Hermes (Mercury)^1🤖 is common: with the benefics he is benefic, and with the malefics he is malefic. Regarding the benefics and malefics, I have said that they are so considered, since often in certain nativities the malefics, being well situated by aspect, sect, and place, increase good fortune, while the benefics, being badly situated, harm it. For Dorotheus says in this connection: "Malefics in trine are weakened; and a star is no longer base if it finds a good place, nor is a place bad when it welcomes a worthy star."^2🤖

3. On the Temperament of the Twelve Signs.

We have said that Aries is fiery, Taurus earthy, Gemini airy, Cancer watery; likewise, Leo is fiery, Virgo earthy, Libra airy, Scorpio watery; and again, Sagittarius is fiery, Capricorn earthy, Aquarius airy, Pisces watery. Thus, the triangle of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius is fiery; the triangle of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn is earthy; the triangle of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius is airy; the triangle of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces is watery.

This has not been said by the ancients without good reason. For since all material things are composed of these four elements or bodies, it is necessary that man, as one who partakes of the same nature, should also share in these four elements. And they assigned the four angles (centers/pivots)^3🤖 of the nativity—i.e., the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, and Imum Coeli, which are the cardinal points of the chart—according to the four temperaments of these elements, as follows: if Aries rises—that is, a fiery sign—and Capricorn culminates—that is, an earthy sign—and Libra sets, an airy sign...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Hermes” is the Greek name for Mercury; both names are included for clarity and fidelity to the original astrological context.

^2🤖 "Malefics in trine are weakened..." preserves standard astrological terminology, where "trine" refers to a 120-degree aspect generally regarded as benevolent. Alternative translations might use "evil-doers" or "when triangular," but "malefics" and "trine" are preferred in scholarly astrological English.

^3🤖 The Greek word "κέντρα" (kentra) is here rendered as "angles (centers/pivots)" to clarify that it refers to the four cardinal points of the horoscope: Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, and Imum Coeli. "Angles" is the standard term, but the explanatory alternatives are given for scholarly completeness.
