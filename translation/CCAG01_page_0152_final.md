And the benefic ones are considered to be the Sun, Zeus, Moon, and Aphrodite, while the malefic ones are Saturn and Ares; for Hermes, being common, is benefic with the benefics and malefic with the malefics. Concerning the benefics and malefics, I have said that they are considered as such because often, in certain nativities, malefic planets, being well placed in respect to aspect, sect, or place, can magnify the fortunes, while the benefics, being badly situated, can harm them; for Dorotheus in relation to this chapter says: “The malefics in trine are weakened; a star is no longer base once it finds a good place; nor is a place bad when it welcomes a worthy star.”

And they assigned the four angles of the nativity in accordance with the four mixtures of these elements, as for example: if Aries is rising—which is a fiery sign—and Capricorn is at the Midheaven—which is an earthy sign—and Libra is setting, which is an airy sign...
