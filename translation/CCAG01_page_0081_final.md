LLM Translation Footnotes

^1ðŸ¤– In the phrase "How it is possible to find in how many years in each <house> a zodiac sign rises, and in how many it sets," the indefinite article ("a zodiac sign") reflects that the treatise discusses the phenomenon generally, not a specific sign. The angular brackets "<house>" indicate a likely editorial interpolation, preserved from the source.

^2ðŸ¤– The closing Greek note is fragmentary. The translation preserves its abruptness and content, following the source's interrupted structure and reflecting the sense: "It should be noted that the first thousand years of the world â€” he knows the hidden things." The phrase acknowledges uncertainty in the text and an allusion to esoteric knowledge.
