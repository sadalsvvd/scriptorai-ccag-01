LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Olioscopy" is a technical term for oil-divination; the parenthetical clarifies for non-specialists. The phrase “establishes expulsion by force” retains the fragmentary style of the original and may refer to some form of ritual banishment or medical expulsion; see parallels in ancient divinatory practice.  
^2🤖 This passage summarizes Autolycus' note on the heliacal rising of fixed stars; the elliptical phrasing "at the end as it sets" follows the Greek's sequence.  
^3🤖 “Afflicted” is the standard technical English for planets or degrees harmed by certain aspects; the Greek may admit alternative renderings, but "weakened" is less conventional.  
^4🤖 "Scorching" translates a term like καύσων, referring to the conjunction of a planet with the Sun (i.e., the "burning" or combustion in astrological terminology).  
^5🤖 "Opēnika" (Ὁπήνικα) is transliterated due to uncertainty; its precise referent is unclear and may require further philological analysis.  
^6🤖 "Embremion" is left as a transliteration with a question mark, indicating that the Greek term in the manuscript is obscure; further study might clarify its meaning.  
^7🤖 “The body is not corrupted” follows the literal Greek, but the precise implication—possibly about the physical effects of conjunctions—remains ambiguous.  
^8🤖 "Exaltation" is the established technical term for the astrological concept of a planet being in its place of greatest strength.
