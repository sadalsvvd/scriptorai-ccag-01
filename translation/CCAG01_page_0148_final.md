III. — r, s.

Of the codices which I have enumerated above, none presents chapters except those found in codex L. However, I have inspected two more complete codices, which I will soon describe in more detail. For now, let this suffice.

r = Munich 287 (14th century), folio 107: Ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν διήγησις καὶ ἐπίλυσις (scil. ταύτης) πάσης ἀστρονομικῆς τέχνης (“From the Treasuries of Antiochus: Account and Solution of the Entire Art of Astronomy”). You see that the title agrees with L, and likewise individual readings here and there correspond with those in the oldest codex. Codex r contains the following chapters extant in L: prooemium, 1, 2, 4+5+6, 7–12, 15, 16, 19+22, 23, 29, 48, 47, part of chapter 51, chapterlet 53; all of which, except chapters 47, 48, and 53, I have diligently collated in codex r, where they are all mutilated. And although many things in r are interpolated or omitted, I have still made useful use of it, since it alone sometimes preserves genuine readings. But in addition, r contains either 11 or 14 chapters of the Rhetorian treatise that I have not found in L. I will publish these along with others in the catalog of Munich astrological manuscripts.

s = Berlin 173 (Philipp. gr. 1577, 15th century), folia 139r–146v. It is inscribed: Ῥητορίου θησαυρὸς συνεκμν τὸ πᾶν τῆς ἀστρονομίας (“The Treasury of Rhetorius, a compendium of the entirety of astronomy”). The first chapter begins: Ὁ ζωδιακὸς κύκλος κινείται λοξῶς ἔχων τμήματα ιβ′ (“The zodiacal circle moves obliquely, having twelve divisions”). On folio 144r, a second chapter follows: Περὶ τῆς τῶν πλανωμένων ἀστέρων φύσεως καὶ δυνάμεως καὶ ὧν κυριεύει μελῶν ἕκαστος· καὶ τί σημαίνει (“On the nature and power of the wandering stars, and which members each rules, and what [this] signifies”). Finally, on folio 145v: ἐπίλυσις καὶ διήγησις πάντων τῶν προειρημένων. Incipit: Τίνος ἕνεκα τῶν δώδεκα ζῴδιων (“Explanation and account of all the aforesaid. Begins: For what reason concerning the twelve signs…”), ends folio 146v, final line: ὅ ἐστιν ὕδωρ (“…which is water”). You see that this one chapter, of the three contained in cod. Berol., is also found in codex L. The first two chapters I will publish together with the chapters from codex r; the third chapter I have collated with the text of codex L.

As to why I have not thought fit to carry out a recension of Porphyrian chapters of this treatise, I shall say in a few words. Indeed, unless you have Porphyry entire, you can scarcely elucidate what words belong to Porphyry and what to Rhetorius. Accordingly, when the codices L and r differ from the edition of the Porphyrian introduction, I have considered it sufficient to annotate this. However, I have decided neither here nor elsewhere to adduce matters that are merely orthographical; nor have I transcribed all manifest errors of the more recent codices, unless moved by more serious grounds.

For what reason we have made the beginning of the twelve zodiacal signs, arranged in a circle, from Aries, and not rather from Cancer, at which the cosmic ascendant occurs, or from Leo as a solar sign, but
