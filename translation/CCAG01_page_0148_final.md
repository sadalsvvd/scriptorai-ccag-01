III. — r, s.

Of the manuscripts I have enumerated above, none present the chapters except those found in codex L. However, I have consulted two more complete manuscripts, which I shall describe more fully in due course; for now, these remarks will suffice.

r = Munich 287 (14th century) fol. 107: “From the Treasuries of Antiochus: Exposition and Solution (i.e., account and explanation) of the Whole Art of Astronomy.” You will see that the title agrees with that of L; moreover, various readings here and there also correspond with the oldest codex. Codex r contains the following chapters also found in L: the prooemium, 1, 2, 4+5+6, 7–12, 15, 16, 19+22, 23, 29, 48, 47, part of chapter 51, and chapter 53; apart from chapters 47, 48, and 53, I have carefully collated all of these, although in cod. r all but these three are mutilated. And although r contains many interpolations and many omissions, still it has not been without its utility, since at times it alone has preserved the genuine readings. Furthermore, r offers either 11 or 14 chapters of the Rhetorian treatise which are not found in L. I shall publish these, together with others, in the catalogue of Munich astrological manuscripts.

s = Berlin 173 (Philipp. gr. 1577, 15th century) fol. 139r–146v. It is titled: “The Treasury of Rhetorius, a Summary of the Whole of Astronomy.” The first chapter begins: “The zodiacal circle moves obliquely, having twelve divisions.” On fol. 144r, the next chapter follows: “Concerning the nature and power of the wandering stars, and which parts each is ruler of; and what this signifies.” Finally, on fol. 145v: “Solution and Exposition of all the aforesaid.” It begins: “For what reason, out of the twelve signs, …” and concludes on fol. 146v, last line: “which is water.” You will see that this one chapter, of the three contained in the Berlin codex, is also found in codex L. The first two chapters I will publish along with the chapters of codex r; the third chapter I have collated against the text of codex L.

As to why I have not thought it proper to establish a recension of the chapters of this Porphyrian treatise, I will state in a few words. Scarcely, indeed, can one discern which words belong to Porphyry and which to Rhetorius, before one has access to the whole of Porphyry. Thus, wherever the manuscripts L and r diverge from the edition of the Porphyrian introduction, I have found it sufficient simply to note this. Matters of mere orthography I have decided not to mention, here or elsewhere; nor have I transcribed all the obvious errors of the later manuscripts, unless compelled by more serious considerations.

<Of Rhetorius> From the Treasuries of Antiochus: Exposition and Solution of the Whole Art of Astronomy.

For what reason, out of the twelve zodiacal signs arranged in a circle, we have taken the beginning from Aries and not rather from Cancer, at which the cosmic ascendant is set, or from Leo, as from the solar sign, but

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 On “Exposition and Solution (i.e., account and explanation)”: The Greek terms ἐπίλυσις and διήγησις are best captured here as “exposition and solution,” but “account” or “explanation” are also defensible translations.
^2🤖 On “cosmic ascendant”: “κοσμικὸς ὦροσκόπος” is standardly rendered as “cosmic ascendant” in the scholarly literature, but “cosmical horoscope” is also sometimes used.
^3🤖 “Solar sign” for ἡλιακοῦ ζωδίου is ambiguous in Greek: it may mean simply “the sign of the Sun,” i.e., Leo, but could also be read as “solar zodiac.”
^4🤖 The sentence in the proemium ends in an ellipsis because it continues on the following page.
