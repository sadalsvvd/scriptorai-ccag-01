Selected Chapters of Palchos.

A few words have been said about Palchos the Egyptian astrologer, who flourished toward the end of the 5th century (cf. c. νΖ–νΘʹ, λαʹ, πζʹ, πηʹ), both in Rev. de l’Instr. publ. en Belg. 1897, p. 1ff., and above (p. 84), among the interpreters prohibited in the Middle Ages, where “the interpreter Palchos” is mentioned. The present passages from his work, which we offer here, will provide additional information. The two fragments (λαʹ, πηʹ, cf. πλεʹ) that had previously been published, we here repeat, so that all the texts from this apotelesmatic² book that have so far been published may be found together in one place.

F. 100v (=210v). ιζʹ. On the Loss of Property, according to Erasistratus³: how to find the thief and the thing lost, and where it lies.

He observes according to the centers (κέντρα)^1🤖 as follows: Let the ascendant be the thing lost, the midheaven the thief, the descendant the stealer, the lower midheaven (imum coeli) the place where the lost item lies. Likewise, the Moon also indicates where the lost item lies. If the Moon is at the ascendant, it indicates that the lost item lies in a central and conspicuous place^2🤖. But if it is at the midheaven, the item lies in an elevated place; if it is beneath the earth (at the lower midheaven), it lies in a hollow place or in a pit; if the Moon is at the descendant, it lies in a private and scattered place^3🤖. If Saturn is ascending, the thing lost will be old, or unfinished, or abandoned. One should also inquire about the nature of the star. If Mars is ascending or at a center with the Moon, the theft has been done with violence, with doors broken, or bedrooms^12 or chests or seals^13 forced open. If Jupiter is at the midheaven and together with the Moon, the theft has taken place from a sacred place. If Venus is with the Moon at the center, it indicates that the lost items are of a feminine kind; if Venus is at the midheaven, it indicates the lost things are sacred from a sacred place. If Mercury is at the center or with the Moon, [they are] silver objects, books^17, or documents.

¹ Cf. Studi ital. etc., IV, p. 60ff.—Since it has been shown that the astrological collection of Palchos preserved in the Laurentian codex was copied, though not completely, from the Angelicanus codex (Cumont, L’astrologie Palchos, p. 2), we have decided to publish the excerpts from Palchos’ book according more to the authority of the archetype than to that of the copy.

² The technical term “apotelesmatic” (ἀποτελεσματικός) refers specifically to works dealing with astrological outcomes (effects or results), and is not to be conflated with general astrological treatises.

³ On Erasistratus, cf. the excerpt from Masala above, p. 82, l. 23.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term “centers” translates Greek κέντρα, the angular cardinal points of the astrological chart (ascendant, midheaven, descendant, imum coeli), sometimes also rendered as “angles” or “pivots.” “Centers” is a literal rendering; “angles” is standard in modern astrology, “pivots” is plausible as well.

^2🤖 “Central and conspicuous place” renders the sense of the lost item being in a public or visible location; other interpretations could be “public and visible place.”

^3🤖 “Private and scattered place” interprets Greek ἰδιόκτῳ καὶ ἀνακεχυμένῳ; “scattered” (ἀνακεχυμμένος) might also mean “disarrayed” or “piled up,” thus an area not only private but possibly cluttered or in disorder.
