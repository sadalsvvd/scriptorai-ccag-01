Selected Chapters of Palchos.

Concerning Palchos, the Egyptian astrologer who flourished at the end of the 5th century CE (cf. chap. νΖ–νΘ´, λα’, πζ’, πη´), a few words have been written in the Rev. de l’Instr. publ. en Belg. 1897, p. 1ff., and above (p. 84) he is mentioned among the interpreters prohibited in the Middle Ages, ὁ ἑρμηνευτὴς Πάλχος. More will be revealed by the portions of his work which we here present. We repeat here two fragments (λα’, πη’ cf. πλε’) that had already been published previously, so that all passages from this apotelesmatic [astrological] book thus far published may be found in one place.

f. 100v (=210v). 17. Concerning the loss of an object, according to Erasistratus²: how to find the thief and what was lost and where it lies.

He observes from the cardines [astrological angles] in this way: let the Ascendant be the lost object, the Midheaven the loser, the Descendant the thief, the Imum Coeli where the lost object lies; likewise, the Moon also indicates where the lost object lies. The Moon in the Ascendant indicates that the lost object lies in a central and visible place; if the Moon is at the Midheaven, it lies in a lofty place; if it is at the Imum Coeli, it lies in a hollow place or in a well; the Moon in the Descendant indicates that it lies in a secluded and scattered place. If Saturn is at the Ascendant, the lost object will be old or incomplete or cast aside. Also consider the nature of the planet. If Mars is at the Ascendant or conjunct the Moon, the theft was committed with violence: a lock was broken, or beds or furnishings or seals were forced. If Jupiter is at the Midheaven and with the Moon, the theft occurred from a sacred place. Venus conjunct the Moon at the cardine indicates that the objects lost are women's things; if Venus is at the Midheaven, it indicates that sacred objects from a sacred place have been lost; Mercury at the cardine or with the Moon, [the lost items are] silver or books or documents.

¹ Cf. Studi ital. etc., IV, p. 60ff.—Since it has been shown that the astrological collection of Palchos preserved in the Laurentian codex was copied inexactly from the Angelicanus codex (Cumont, L’astrologie Palchos, p. 2), we have decided to publish excerpts from Palchos’ book according to the authority of the archetype rather than the copy.

² On Erasistratus, cf. above, Masala's excerpt p. 82, l. 23.
