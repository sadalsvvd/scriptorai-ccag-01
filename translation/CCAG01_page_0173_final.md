APPENDIX

F. 130r. ACEPHALOUS EXCERPT ON THE LOTS¹.

… the method for the discovery of the Lots¹ is as follows; therefore, we shall hand down this procedure: and first, we shall begin with the Lot of Fortune, since this divinity is by nature more akin to those born here below, increasing and diminishing affairs, which is why the most divine Hermes Trismegistus^1🤖 likened her to the Moon; next after this, the Lot of the Good Daimon, since from this we are able to discern the character of the soul and its intelligence and disposition, just as from Fortune we learn about the body and all things concerning the body; and indeed, the greatest part of divination is devoted to these matters: to know the character of the soul and the conduct of bodies, and further, to say how the soul conducts itself in civic life after descending into this world, and how the body and the things concerning the body—and, simply put, all things not under our control—come about. For this reason, before all the other Lots, it is necessary to investigate the Lot of the Daimon and of Fortune; moreover, there is another reason—namely, that the Lots of the Daimon and of Fortune must be determined beforehand, because from these we derive all the others; for we could not derive the rest without first determining these. Now that these points have been duly explained, let us proceed to our subject and investigate the method by which the Lot of Fortune is cast.

For it is necessary to ascertain in which zodiacal sign and in which degree the Sun was at the time of birth, or, more generally, at the beginning of any undertaking; likewise, in which zodiacal sign and which degree the Moon was present; and, in addition, in which zodiacal sign the Ascendant was, and in which degree; and when these have been discovered, if the nativity is diurnal, then at that point one measures the distance in degrees from the Sun to the Moon; next, to this number thus found, one adds the number of degrees found at the Ascendant; then, beginning at the Ascendant, one counts off, assigning thirty degrees to each zodiacal sign; and one must observe in which sign the final number falls, and in which degree; and there one says the Lot of Fortune is to be found.

¹ We shall hand down cod. 3, we set cod. 4; likened cod. 5. Cf. supra p. 148, 13. Hermes Trismegistus (sic) cod. After this, a word is possibly missing; Fortune cod., emended by Kroll.

¹ I had taken care to describe the beginning and the end of the longer excerpt, which lacks a title and beginning, so that I might discover the author’s name. Nor was my hope altogether disappointed, for the codex Laurentianus provides almost the same things as PAULUS ALEXANDRINUS in his Isagoge, published at Wittenberg in 1888, I, 1a ff., although the codex sometimes differs or is even fuller. And, since Paulus himself claims that he drew these things from the Panaretos of Hermes, it is not clear whether the Laurentian excerpt is derived from the same source or, as seems more likely, a certain Byzantine astrologer compiled a patchwork from Paulus and the scholia to Paulus—perhaps those of Heliodoros.
