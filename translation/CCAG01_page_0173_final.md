F. 130r. HEADLESS EXCERPT ON THE LOTS¹.

…the method for finding the Lots¹; therefore, we will set forth this method. First, we shall begin with the Lot of Fortune, since this goddess, being more akin to those born here below, increases and diminishes circumstances, for which reason the most divine Hermes Trismegistus also likened her to the Moon. Next after this is the Lot of the Good Daimon, since from this we are able to know the character and intelligence of the soul, just as from Fortune we discern matters concerning the body and the things pertaining to the body. For it is especially concerning these things that the greatest divination is engaged—namely, to discover the dispositions of the soul and the modes of life of bodies, and, in particular, to say in what way the soul conducts itself in this world after descending from above, and in what way both the body and matters pertaining to the body, and, in general, to state how all things that do not depend on us come to pass. For this reason, before all other Lots, we must seek the Lot of Daimon and of Fortune. Moreover, another reason is that from these all others are derived—for we cannot determine the others before these have been determined. Since, then, these things have been rightly stated, let us proceed to the matter at hand and examine the method by which the Lot of Fortune is determined.

For it is necessary to consider in what sign and in what degree the Sun was at the time of birth, or, more generally, at the commencement of any action; likewise, in what sign and degree the Moon was, and in addition, in what sign the Ascendant was, and in what degree. When these have been ascertained, if the nativity is diurnal, then measure the distance in degrees from the Sun to the Moon; then, to this number thus obtained, add the number found at the Ascendant; then, in this way, proceed from the Ascendant, giving thirty degrees to each sign; and observe in what sign the resulting number ends and in what degree. Declare that the Lot of Fortune is located there.

¹ The beginning and end of this rather lengthy excerpt, which lacks a title and beginning, I took care to transcribe so that I might be able to discover the name of the author. Nor was my hope wholly disappointed, for the Laurentian manuscript offers almost verbatim the same content as that which PAULUS ALEXANDRINUS presents in the Isagoge, published at Wittenberg, 1888, I, 1a ff., although at times it diverges or is even fuller. And since Paulus himself acknowledges having drawn this material from the Panaretos of Hermes, it is not clear whether the Laurentian excerpt derives from the same source or—more likely—a Byzantine astrologer compiled a patchwork from Paulus and the scholia on Paulus, perhaps those of Heliodorus.
