...through three, so that we are perplexed as to in which place each of the stars is; we must distinguish the places in this manner: introducing both the horoscope and the midheaven degree of the zodiac onto the upright circle of the sphere, we take their respective ascensional times. And since it has been stated by Ptolemy that the centers are effective from five of the aforementioned degrees, subtracting five degrees from the ascensional times and, having taken the degrees of the zodiac corresponding to the remaining ascensional times as well, we have the beginnings of the horoscope and the midheaven. Then, taking a third of the difference of such ascensional times and subtracting it from the ascensional times corresponding to the beginning of the horoscope, and entering the remaining values into the same upright circle of the sphere, and having taken the corresponding zodiacal degrees, we have the beginning of the twelfth place. Doing the same also for the remaining centers, through the addition and subtraction of the ascensional times of the upright sphere, we have the beginnings of all the places.

Saturn in conjunction with the horoscope signifies that slaughter will occur according to that place; but if he is distant from the center, slaughter will be in the adjoining places, and far from the place. If the luminaries are at the centers and are aspected by the malefics, being in opposition or square to them, they signify that matters will be difficult. In every matter, it is especially necessary to be watchful when the Moon is in the eclipsing conjunctions, particularly at the conjunctions, except for those of purification. At the attack of the Turks, Saturn was found at the Descendant and signified our harm; for those who advance are taken from the horoscope, but those against whom they advance are from the Descendant. If a malefic star is rising and is configured with another malefic and none of the benefics acts upon it, he about whom the question is asked has already died.

The Moon, when she happens to be in the ninth place, quickly brings matters to dissolution; for good things, such as honors, she acts thus; but for bad things, she even increases their badness more quickly, to the worse, as also happened in the exile of Photius the patriarch.
