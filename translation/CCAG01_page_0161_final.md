...through two and a half degrees; it ends in Aquarius to complete the balance with two and a half degrees. But if I make the twenty-five from the thirteen, the number ends in Pisces at twenty-five degrees, and this difference turns out to be considerable. The method of dodecatemoria is necessary for nativities; I have also indicated their outcomes, so that some may not make use of these things as in a subsidiary manner.

19. On Hearing and Seeing.
Both the hearing and seeing signs contribute to plants, dangers, phases, and likewise to messages, when the Moon is carried by transit to Mercury or the benefics, at the beginning of the inquiry into this section. The signs that see each other are as follows: Gemini sees Leo, and Leo sees Gemini; likewise, Scorpio hears Virgo, and Virgo hears Scorpio, and so on in succession.

20. On Observation.
With these being so divided, “to observe” (epitheōrein) is said when the leading sign bears testimony to the following, whether by hexagon, square, triangle, or diameter; for it is distant from the preceding when it is carried forward. For the planets move in the direction opposite to that of the zodiacal signs, yet they nevertheless make their own course and are carried along with it every day and night.

21. On Raycasting.
Raycasting (aktinobolia), as said, is when the following sign irradiates the leading one in these figures; for either its ray of light is borne toward the following, itself being absent, or toward the preceding; for example, the one in Aries observes the one in Cancer, and the one in Cancer raycasts to the one in Aries.

22. On Right and Left Sides.
The right-hand figures are those among the antecedent signs of the Zodiac, and the left-hand those among the following, as, for example, Cancer rises at 30 degrees, the right hexagon.
