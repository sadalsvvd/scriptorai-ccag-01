...by two and a half degrees; it terminates in Aquarius to complete the Libra in respect to the two and a half degrees. But if I make twenty-five from thirteen, the result falls in Pisces at twenty-five degrees, and this difference becomes considerable. The method of dodecatemoria^1🤖 is necessary for nativities; and I have indicated also their effects, so that some may not apply these only as incidental matters^2🤖.

19. Concerning “Hearing” and “Seeing” Signs.  
Both the “hearing” and “seeing” signs contribute to the growth of plants, to dangers, to phases, and also to messages, when the Moon moves in passage toward Hermes’ (i.e., Mercury’s) or the benefics’ stars, these being considered at the outset among those examined in this context. The signs that “see” one another are as follows: Gemini “sees” Leo, and Leo “sees” Gemini; likewise, Scorpio and Virgo “hear” each other, and Virgo [hears] Scorpio, and so on, in order.

20. Concerning Inspection.  
With these divisions as outlined above, “inspection”^3🤖 occurs when the preceding planet “inspects” or “bears witness” to the following planet, whether in hexagonal (sextile), tetragonal (square), triangular (trine), or diametric (opposition) aspect; for it is set apart as regards those that precede as it moves forward. For the planets move in contrary motion to the zodiacal signs, yet each maintains its own course and is carried along with them each day and night.

21. Concerning Ray-Casting.  
“Ray-casting”^4🤖 occurs, according to the aforementioned configurations, when the following planet “casts its ray” toward the preceding planet; for either its own ray is directed toward those that follow during its absence, or toward those that precede: for example, the one in Aries “inspects” the one in Cancer, and the one in Cancer “casts its ray” toward the one in Aries.

22. Concerning Right and Left Aspects.  
Right-hand aspects are those among the preceding signs of the Zodiac, and left-hand aspects those among the following; for example, Cancer aspects the thirtieth degree—a right-hand hexagon.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Dodecatemoria” refers to twelfth-parts or a specialized division of zodiacal signs used in Hellenistic astrology; “dodecatemories” is a pluralized Anglicization, but the singular Greek noun is generally preferred in scholarly usage.

^2🤖 The original Greek uses παρέργον (“parergon”)—meaning a secondary, incidental, or digressive matter. “Incidental matters” preserves the nuance that these should not be treated as mere side-issues, rather than “as a digression” (an alternate rendering).

^3🤖 The Greek ἐπιθεωρεῖν is sometimes translated “regard” or “aspect,” but “inspection” adheres to ancient technical usage in astrological context for when one planet actively witnesses or observes another in a specific geometrical relationship.

^4🤖 “Ray-casting” (ἀκτινοβολία) is a technical term for a planetary aspect involving the transmission of astrological influence, typically understood as “casting a ray” from one planet to another.
