Karshionically it is indicated to you: if the Moon is positioned with a star in the second or third line, and when in the third, it possesses bravery derived from the Nile. This star itself is hostile to those from Greater Asia; and in the second line, it is hostile to those present and enslaved, but it is favorable to those who are still free.

As for Arctos^1ðŸ¤– in the third? The opposite.

Those same [authors]^2ðŸ¤– said that Kronos and Poseidon are harmful to those from the Nile, and that there is an indication (horisma) of the destruction of every workshop.

Cetus in the third: Kronos is a hero; but for the one in the first, a mixture of evils will arise, and after enduring, dreadful things will come.

And those stars present in the second join themselves to it, variously evil, and it is fated that the pain of prosperity befall them.

For Arctos does not blow in this hour, and when it rises, it is not possible to see.

The lives of city-dwellers and their stomachs are turned four ways toward hopeless expectations^3ðŸ¤–.

Poseidon is [signified as] a field, and hostile men in the head.

As for Kronos in the hand, he causes nearly oppression and toil.

And among the rest of the stars, there is no leisurely scribe, just as with Cygnus^4ðŸ¤– on its pedestal.

Ion signifies a beginning of dancing and misfortune^5ðŸ¤–.

One could not hide, nor will matters be possible, lest ever from contrary directions there attack a collision of impulses^6ðŸ¤–.

Therefore, all the rest ought to possess the entirety of evil.
