Karshionically, it is indicated to you that if the Moon is placed on the second or third line, and when it is in the third, it possesses courage from the Nile. This star is hostile to those from Greater Asia; but in the second line, it is hostile to those present and enslaved, while it is beneficial for those who are still free.

As for Arctos on the third: the opposite. The same authorities said that Kronos and Poseidon bring evil to those from the Nile, and signify the ruin of every workshop as a boundary.

KÄ“tos in the third: Kronos is a hero. But for the one in the first, a mingling of evils will arise, and, after enduring, terrible things may occur.

But the stars present in the second align with it, being wholly evil, and the fortune of labor comes about.

For Arctos does not breathe at this hour, and whenever it rises, it cannot be seen.

The urbane possess the life of mortals and the appetite, being turned in all directions toward hopeless expectation.

Poseidon is a field and brings hostile men to the head.

Kronos in the hand nearly brings distress and toil.

And among the remaining stars, there is no leisurely scribe, just as Cygnus is upon the pedestals.

Ion signifies a departure from dance, and misfortune.

One cannot hide these things, and that which is impossible will nevertheless come to pass, lest ever one be hindered by opposing impulses, as if by a hostile blow.

Therefore, it is fitting that even the remainder share in the whole of evil.
