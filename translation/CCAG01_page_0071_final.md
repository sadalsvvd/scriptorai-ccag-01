LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "androgynous and childless" is an interpretative rendering of likely Greek technical terms relating to sexual ambiguity and childlessness, and the inquiry "which of them is sterile?" refers to determining sterility in such a context. The instruction, "Take the man from the Ascendant — say she is barren," preserves the original ambiguity, as the Greek could refer to either member of an ambiguous pair.  
^2🤖 The Greek phrase "εἴτε τεθνηκώς" could also be rendered "whether it is dead," referring to inquiring about whether the fetus/child has died.
