APPENDIX

Why does Ares bring about adultery with Aphrodite? Is it not clear that every adultery arises from pleasure and fear—that is, from Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus)? But observe again how Aphrodite, consorting with Kronos (Saturn), causes those so begotten to be childless, unlucky in offspring, or even unmarried, blending aspects of both natures. You will find the cause: since Kronos has a cold and dry nature, and, as previously stated, chills and dries out the pleasurable and generative spirit—how will there arise procreation, or will the marriage not rather be unclean because of the aged or impure nature of the star?

9. Concerning the selection of the rulers of the trigons.

Each side of a trigon—by “trigon” I mean one measured by three signs of the zodiac; for example, from Aries to Leo, from Leo to Sagittarius, and from Sagittarius to Aries, there are three signs, and these make up a trigon side. The line in the zodiacal circle is of 120 degrees, for three times one hundred and twenty makes 360 degrees, which is the number of degrees in the whole zodiacal circle. Of this trigon side, the rulers are: the ruler by day is the Sun, by night Zeus (Jupiter); the third and common ruler is Kronos (Saturn). Again, for Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn the rulers are: the ruler by day is Aphrodite (Venus); by night, Selene (the Moon); the third and common ruler is Ares (Mars). Again, for Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius the rulers are: the ruler by day is Kronos (Saturn); by night, Hermes (Mercury); the third and common ruler is Zeus (Jupiter). Again, for Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces the rulers are: the ruler by day is Aphrodite (Venus); by night, Ares (Mars); the third and common ruler is Selene (the Moon). As for the functions and outcomes of these rulers of the trigons, you will find them in what precedes.
