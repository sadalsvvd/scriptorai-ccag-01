APPENDIX

For what reason does Ares commit adultery with Aphrodite? Is it not evident that every act of adultery is composed of pleasure and fear—that is, from Ares and Aphrodite? Consider once more Aphrodite in union with Kronos: how does she cause those so begotten to be sterile, childless, unlucky in offspring, or even unmarried, in whom the natures of both are mingled? You will discover the cause: for since Kronos is of a cold and dry nature and, as previously stated, cools and dries the pleasurable and generative spirit, how shall procreation occur, or marriage be fruitful, except that the marriage is barren, or the nature of the star renders it aged or unclean?^1🤖

9. On the Selection of the Lords of the Trigons.

Each trigon side—by this I mean the side counted off by five zodiacal signs; for example, from Aries to Leo, from Leo to Sagittarius, and from Sagittarius to Aries—results in five signs, comprising a trigon side. The line in the zodiacal circle extends thirty degrees; for three times one hundred and twenty is three hundred and sixty degrees, which is the complete number contained in the whole circle. Of this trigon side, the lords are: the Sun by day, Zeus^2🤖 by night, and the third, the common ruler, is Kronos. Again, for Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, the lords are: Aphrodite by day, the Moon by night, and the third and co-ruler is Ares. Again, for Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, the lords are: Kronos by day, Hermes by night, and the third and co-ruler is Zeus. Again, for Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, the lords are: Aphrodite by day, Ares by night, and the third and co-ruler is the Moon. You will find the uses and results of these trigon lords in the preceding sections.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek phrase ἢ γάμος ἀρυπάρους ἔξει διὰ τὸ πρεσβυτικὸν ἢ ῥυπαρὸν τῆς φύσεως τοῦ ἀστέρος is complex, with several manuscript variants. I have rendered ἀρυπάρους as "barren" and πρεσβυτικὸν as "aged," but other witness readings suggest "unclean" (ῥυπαρὸν). The translation here aims to reflect the range of possible meanings for scholarly completeness.

^2🤖 The name "Zeus" (Ζεὺς) is used here to refer to the planet Jupiter, as is standard in ancient astrological texts.
