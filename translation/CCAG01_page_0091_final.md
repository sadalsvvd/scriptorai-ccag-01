EXCERPT FROM CODEX 2 (Laur. 28, 17).

Samspuchari on the reckoning of times.

Thanks to the kindness of Hermann Usener, who generously shared with us his own copy—carefully transcribed, corrected in many places, and drawn forth from the most distinguished archives—it was thus possible for us to present this specimen of Persian science. Σαμψουχαρῆς, or more correctly Σάμψ τουχαρῆς, to whom this work is ascribed by the Greek translator, is Sams al-Dīn al-Bukhārī, an astronomer who appears to have flourished in the thirteenth century (cf. Usener, Contributions to the History of Astronomy, Bonn, 1876, p. 15, note d, and pp. 22 ff.). Introductions of the kind we are publishing are often found at the beginnings of works of oriental astronomy or historiography, as, for instance, with Al-Farghani (Elements of Astronomy, ed. Golius, 1669) and Al-Bīrūnī (Chronology of Ancient Nations, ed. Sachau, 1879), a man of outstanding learning and far greater than the aforementioned Bukharan. I have not attempted to correct the barbarous style of the Greek translator, who was unskilled in the language. It is sufficient to note that the words χρόνος (“year”) and καιρός (“time”) should be taken in their colloquial sense; ἔτος is used for “period of years,” and τὸν ψῆφον is always said.

C. 4. Diagnosis of the Times.^1🤖

Here it will be explained how each nation reckons time:
    the Persians, Christians, Hebrews, Pagans, Hittites^2🤖, astronomers, and Indians.

The astronomers primarily reckon time from the sun,
    counting the beginning of the year from there, that is, from the rising of the sun.^3🤖

The Persians, on the other hand, count the years from the moon,
    and take the beginning of the year from Muharram,^4🤖
    and they reckon the beginning of their months from that point, when they see the new moon.^5🤖

The Christians count the years from the sun; but not precisely,
    because a year for them is three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter,
    and it is said that this period of the sun is not completed,
    for something is lacking from the quarter;
    nevertheless, they maintain this reckoning because the solar year is very close to being complete;^6🤖
    and they set the beginning of their year at the middle of Libra;
    but they also reckon the beginning of their months from September.

8 Muharram = Muharram, the first month of the Arabic calendar.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek διάγνωσις may be rendered as “diagnosis,” “explanation,” or “account”; “diagnosis” is retained here for accuracy, but alternatives are possible.

^2🤖 The word translated as “Hittites” is Χεταῖοι; some manuscripts and scholars read this as “Chaldaeans.” The identification is not certain and might reflect differing traditions.

^3🤖 The phrase “from there, that is, from the rising of the sun” explicates the Greek, clarifying the reckoning of the year from the solar or sunrise point.

^4🤖 Rendering the Greek ἀπὸ τοῦ Μουχαράμ as “from Muharram,” in reference to the first month of the Islamic lunar calendar under Persian reckoning of this era.

^5🤖 The Greek participial construction indicates the practice of reckoning a month’s beginning by observing the new moon; this phrasing preserves that nuance.

^6🤖 This sentence summarizes the passage’s sense that the solar year, as used by Christians, is nearly complete (i.e., regarding the Julian year’s slight imperfection). Alternative renderings may emphasize the solar year’s “perfection,” but the underlying sense is one of near-completeness.
