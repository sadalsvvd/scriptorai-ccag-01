EXCERPT FROM CODEX 2 (Laur. 28, 17).

Samspuchari on the reckoning of times.

Thanks to the kindness of Hermann Usener, who generously shared with us his own copy, carefully transcribed and corrected throughout, brought forth from the most distinguished archives, it has become possible for us to present this specimen of Persian science. Σαμψουχαρῆς, or more correctly Σάμψ τουχαρῆς, to whom this work is ascribed by the Greek translator, is Sams of Bukhara (Sams Aldin al-Bukhārī?), an astronomer who appears to have flourished in the 13th century. (Cf. Usener, Ad historiam astronomiae symbola, Bonn, 1876, p. 15, note d and 22ff.)—Commentaries of this kind are not infrequently found at the beginnings of works by eastern astronomers or historical writers, as, for example, in Alfergani (Elementa astronomica, ed. Golius, 1669) and Albirūnī (Chronology of Ancient Nations, ed. Sachau, 1879), a man of extraordinary learning and much more distinguished than that Bukhari.—I have not wished to correct the barbarous style of the Greek interpreter who was unskilled in the language. It will suffice to warn the reader that the words χρόνος [year] and καιρός [time] are to be taken in their colloquial sense, that ἔτος is used for the period of years, and that τὸν ψῆφον [the number/count] is perpetually so called.

G. 4. The reckoning of times.

Here it will be stated how each nation reckons the times: Persians, Christians, Hebrews, Idolaters, Hittites, astronomers, Indians.

Astronomers properly reckon time from the sun, counting the beginning of the year from the rising of the sun.

The Persians, on the other hand, reckon the times from the moon, and they reckon the first period from Muharram; further, they consider the beginning of their month to be from that event, when they see the new moon.

The Christians reckon times from the sun; but this is not entirely accurate, because one of their years is three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter, and it has been said that this period of the sun is not complete; for something is lacking from the quarter. Nevertheless, they keep this reckoning on that account, since the period of the sun is by far nearer to perfection; and they set the beginning of their reckoning at the midpoint of Libra; but they also reckon the beginning of their months from September.

8 Muharram = Moharem, Arabic: the first month.
