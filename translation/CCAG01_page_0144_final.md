Scholium on v. 9:  
Because when the lords of the ascendant and the Moon are in opposition, they bring about death in a foreign land; and if they are also malefics, they cause death by violence.^1🤖  
[F. C.]

Folio 83. Julianus on Inceptions.

And the divine Petosiris, speaking about inceptions, says thus: consider the Sun and the Moon and the rulers of both, as well as the ascendant and the midheaven, and in which of the aforementioned positions the Moon and its ruler are situated.  
For if the ruler of the Moon is in declining places^2🤖, but the Moon itself is angular, at first the matter will be splendid, but the end will not be the same; for all beginnings of things are determined from the Moon, but the outcomes from its ruler.  
But if the Moon is declining, and its ruler is angular, the beginning of the matter will go with difficulty and be slow, but its outcome will be good and steady. If both the Moon and its ruler are angular from start to finish, they indicate that the matter will be good; but if they find themselves in declining places, the opposite holds. Should the ruler of the Moon be in the "returns," he signifies that time will pass, but the matter will be accomplished. Also, consider the separations of the Moon and its applications:  
For if the Moon separates from a benefic, it is not favorable, except for one wishing to escape as a slave^3🤖; but if it applies to a benefic, it indicates a good outcome for the matter, whereas applications to malefics indicate a bad one. One must examine the future from the applications, but the present or what has already happened from the separations.  
Also consider the Lot of Fortune: if it is testified to by benefics, it indicates a good outcome; if by malefics, a bad one.

On loss, fugitives, and debt.

On any inception, if the ruler of the Moon testifies to it, what is lost will be found, the fugitive will return, and the debtor will pay—whether slowly or quickly, this you will know from the angles and the mutual applications. But if before the Moon

Codex 28, 34 (A) was transcribed by Al. Olivieri and Richard Wuensch. Likewise, R. Wuensch has published variant readings from codex 28, 13 f. 158r (B), with which Marcianus 335 f. 89r, collated by Wilhelm Kroll, mostly agrees.  
Otherwise: "of Julianus" B 2 Petosiris cf. Riess Philologus Suppl. VI, p. 388. "Concerning inceptions," as stated in B. 3 "also the" B. 4 "place of these stands" B.

^1🤖 “ἀναιροῦσιν” literally means “remove,” “destroy,” or “kill”; “bring about death” is interpretive. The phrase “ἐπὶ ξένης τελευτᾶν” means “to die abroad” or “to end [one’s life] in a foreign land.”
^2🤖 “Declining places” translates ἀποκλίματα, the cadent houses in ancient astrology (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th), generally weaker positions in a chart.
^3🤖 The phrase πλὴν δούλῳ δραπετεύσασα βουλομένη means that the drawback of separating from a benefic does not apply if someone seeks to escape as a slave, a standard exception in astrological literature.
