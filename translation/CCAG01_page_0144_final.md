Scholium on v. 9:  
That the rulers of the horoscope and of the Moon, when they oppose each other by diameter, produce death in a foreign land; and if they are malefics as well, [they produce] violent death.

F. 83. Julianus, On Inceptions.

The divine Petosiris, speaking concerning inceptions, says thus: Examine the Sun and the Moon, and the lords of both, and the horoscope, and the midheaven, and in which of the aforesaid places the Moon and her lord stand.  
For if the lord of the Moon is in declining places, but the Moon herself is angular, at first the matter will be splendid, but the end will not be the same; for the beginnings of every matter are taken from the Moon, but the ends from her lord.  
But if the Moon is in declining places, and her lord is angular, the beginnings of the matter will be difficult and slow, but the ends fair and secure. If both the Moon and her lord are angular from beginning to end, they indicate the matter is good; but if they both are in declining places, the opposite. If the lord of the Moon happens to be in the places of return (or in retrogradation), he says that the matter will last for a time, but will be accomplished. And also examine the separations of the Moon and her conjunctions;  
for if she separates from a benefic, it is not favorable, except for a slave seeking to escape; but if she conjoins with a benefic, it indicates that the outcome of the matter is good, whereas with malefics, bad. And it is necessary to judge the future from the conjunctions, but the present or the already-occurred from the separations.  
Examine also the Lot of Fortune; if it is aspected by benefics, it indicates a good end, but if by malefics, a bad one.

On Loss, Runaways, and Debt.

In every inception, if the lord of the Moon testifies to her, the lost thing will be found, and the runaway will return, and the debtor will recover what is owed, whether slowly or quickly; this you will know from the angles and the applications. If, before the Moon comes to her

Codices 28, 34 (A) were transcribed by Al. Olivieri and Richard Wuensch. Likewise, R. Wuensch collected variant readings from codex 28, 13 fol. 158r (B), with which Marcianus 335 fol. 89r, collated by Wilhelm Kroll, mostly agrees.
