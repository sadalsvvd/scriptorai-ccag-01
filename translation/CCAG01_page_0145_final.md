…the house-ruler <comes> to it; if the house-ruler does not stand apart from the sign and depart, if at first it is in quadrature to it, but then becomes trine to it after changing, what results will have a brief delay. But if it passes from trine to the incongruous sign, the matter will not be accomplished—except whenever the house-ruler of the Moon comes again to the same sign in which it stood at the inception.  

If the Moon is afflicted by malefics, being together with them in a sign, but benefics observe it in quadrature, release is provided. If the Moon comes by quadrature to one of the benefics, it grants a good outcome for the matter; but if it comes into quadrature with both benefics and malefics, there will be a mixed result for the matter—both harm and benefit—and one must fear lest the malefics bring harm, and the benefics not be able to confer full benefit. If the Moon moves from malefic to malefic, by bodily conjunction or by aspect, the matters will proceed from bad to worse.  

It is necessary in every inception to examine both the Ascendant and the Moon; but if the inception is nocturnal, consider the Moon in the hemisphere above the earth, and if diurnal, in the hemisphere beneath, or according to the Ascendant.^1🤖  

Scholia of Leo the Philosopher on the text of Hermes.

By this same example and this same error, Porphyry too was caught, being unlearned and far from the mind of the great Ptolemy; for in the matter of the governor (aphetes) in Sagittarius, he does not arrive at the setting point in five days but in forty,^2🤖 for the rule of the fifth climate does not concern the settings (descents) of Sagittarius and Libra, but clearly their ascensions. Therefore, if, in this first position, Aries 10° is the Ascendant and corresponds to ascensional times of five and forty; and, in the second position, Sagittarius is setting at 8°, then Gemini 8° ought to be ascending, having ascensional times of forty-five and forty-five; the excess is not five but forty and five minutes.

Since it often happens that the distance between the Ascendant and the Midheaven does not occur over four signs but even over five and…

^1🤖 The expression "hemisphere above the earth" and "beneath" refer to the Moon being above or below the horizon, corresponding to nocturnal and diurnal inceptions, respectively.

^2🤖 The Greek uses the numerals σε’ (5) and μ’ (40), hence “five days” and “forty days.” The text contrasts these computations in ascensional astrology.
