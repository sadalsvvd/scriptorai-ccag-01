LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Wandering stars" is a literal translation of the traditional terminology for planets. Readers may substitute "planets" for clarity.  
^2🤖 The terms "application," "adherence," and "separation" are standard renderings of Greek συναφή, κόλλησις, and διαχωρισμός in traditional astrology. Alternate interpretations include "conjunction," "adhesion," and "emission" or "parting," depending on context and school.  
^3🤖 "Enclosure" here translates Greek ἐμπερισχέσις; alternative renderings in astrological literature include "embedding" or "containment."  
^4🤖 “Irradiation (Every star emits radiance …)” renders both the technical term and the clarification in plain English.  
^5🤖 “The following are on the left” refers to aspects or influences coming from the left (“sinister”) in ancient astrological doctrine.  
^6🤖 “Decanators” translates the Greek ἐπιδεκατευντῶν, those who have rulership over decans (ten-degree divisions); “dominate” translates καθυπερτερούντων (literally “those prevailing by superiority”).  
^7🤖 “Attendance” represents Greek δορυφορία, a technical configuration indicating a benefic form of planetary protection.  
^8🤖 “Nativities” refers to birth charts or horoscopes; “it affects the nativities” means the doctrine is operative in interpreting birth.  
^9🤖 “On the twelve parts...” refers to dodecatemoria, the division of each sign into twelve equal parts.  
^10🤖 For “suitable and unsuitable signs in commencements,” “commencements” should be understood as times of inception, such as elections or beginnings of undertakings.  
^11🤖 The note on the differences between chapter division in various manuscript traditions is retained as in the Latin editor’s note.
