APPENDIX 97

...of the Sun, call old men or old women the thieves or those who have been robbed.  
Now, losses most commonly happen when the Moon or Mercury are afflicted.  
Accordingly, if the malefics are in the east and testify to the Moon, and the benefics are under the west, there will not be recovery of the lost item; just as, if the benefics and Mercury are in the east and testify to the Moon, and the malefics are under the west, there will be recovery of the lost item; both lights rejoice, and recovery is even more favorable when they are above the earth than when in the lower subterranean hemisphere.  
If Saturn is testifying to the Ascendant and to the Moon, say that the theft has taken place by means of some trick or secretly;  
if Jupiter, say that someone of known trustworthiness and freedom has concealed it, and that the theft was committed on the pretense of freedom;  
if Mars, it was done by digging through a wall, by a false key or by breaking open a door, or by breaking a key, or by some violence;  
if Venus, it was done on account of a prostitute or for the sake of an affair with a woman;  
if Mercury, in every case the theft occurred from wickedness or malice.  
As for the place from which it was stolen, proceed as follows:  
Let the Ascendant be for you the entrance, and the Moon indicates the place from which the loss has occurred.  
If, therefore, the Moon is in the Ascendant, the lost item was placed in plain sight;  
even more so, if the Sun aspects the Moon from where the Midheaven is aligned, this indicates an elevated or hanging place;  
if Mars aspects the Moon, whatever was lost, it was lost from a closed place;  
if the Moon is moving toward the west, it was lost from a place that has been deserted;  
if in the lower, subterranean angle, it was taken from an excavated and altogether subterranean low place;  
and while setting, if the significator of the thief aspects the place, say the thief is known.

Timaeus of Praxidikos, Concerning Fugitives and Thieves¹.

If the star of Jupiter happens to be with the Moon, or in the Ascendant, or in the Midheaven,  
the fugitive has carried off silver or plated vessels and goes wherever he wishes;  
if it is also with the Sun, he has carried off much more;  
if Venus and the Sun are in the same places, he has taken icons of saints, and gold, silver, and bronzeware;  
and if Jupiter and Mercury observe [the place],
