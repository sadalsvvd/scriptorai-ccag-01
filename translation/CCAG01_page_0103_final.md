APPENDIX 97

...of the Sun, declare old men or old women to be the thieves or those being robbed.  
Now, losses for the most part occur when the Moon or Hermes are afflicted.  
Therefore, whenever the malefics are in the east and bear witness to the Moon, while the benefics are under the setting,  
there will be no recovery of the lost item; whereas if the benefics and Hermes are in the east and bear witness to the Moon,  
and the malefics are under the setting, there will be a recovery of the lost item. Both lights^1🤖, when they are especially above the earth, are more helpful for discovery than when in the lower hemisphere below the earth.  
If Saturn bears witness to the Ascendant and the Moon, say that the theft happened by some trickery and concealment;  
if Jupiter, say that someone having the reputation for trust and freedom concealed it, and that the theft was committed due to such an assumption;  
if Mars, by digging through a wall or using a false key, by breaking open a door, shattering a bolt, or by some kind of force;  
if Venus, on account of a prostitute or for the sake of affection arising from a woman;  
if Hermes, the theft has certainly arisen from villainy or ill-disposition.  
As for the place whence the object has been carried off, so that you may state it, proceed as follows:  
Let the Ascendant be considered the entrance, and the Moon signifies the place from where the item was lost.  
If the Moon is at the Ascendant, the lost item was set in plain sight;  
even more so if the Sun bears witness to the Moon—when this occurs at the Midheaven, it indicates a hanging or elevated place;  
if Mars bears witness to the Moon, whatever is lost was lost from a locked place;  
if the Moon is moving toward the setting, it was lost from a deserted place;  
if it is in the lower (subterranean) angle, it was taken from an entirely dug-out and subterranean place;  
and if, as it sets, it bears witness to the thief’s place, declare that the thief is known.

Timaeus Praixidēs on Runaways and Thieves¹.

If the star of Zeus (Jupiter) is either with the Moon, or at the Ascendant, or at the Midheaven,  
the runaway has carried off silver-plated^2🤖 or decorated vessels, and goes wherever he wishes;  
if he is also together with the Sun, he has carried off much more;  
if Venus and the Sun are found together in the same places, he has carried off images of holy persons, gold, silver, and bronze^3🤖 objects;  
if, however, Zeus and Hermes are observing...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Both lights” refers to the Sun and Moon, a technical term in ancient astrology for the two luminaries, whose condition together is significant for judgment.

^2🤖 The Greek term ἀργυρώμενα can mean “made of silver” or “silver-plated.” Here, “silver-plated” is chosen to reflect that these are likely not fully silver, but vessels with silver covering.

^3🤖 The manuscript reportedly gives "bronzesmiths" (χαλκωσται), but “bronze objects” (χαλκώματα) is preferred for sense.
