Ares in Virgo at 8°, Zeus in Aquarius at 8°, Aphrodite in Gemini at 7°, Hermes in Leo,** western (setting), separating, Ascendant in Virgo at 2°, Midheaven in Taurus at 26°, Anabibazon [rising degree] in Aries at 11°, Lot of Fortune in Sagittarius at 29°.

Taking the one sailing and governing—the rulers were Kronos and Ares—and again seeing Kronos and Ares at the Ascendant, and the Moon moving towards Kronos, I then said that the ship had fallen into a great storm; but that it would be saved, because Aphrodite and the Moon were seen under the aspect of Zeus, and their heptad (seven-fold division) was brought toward Zeus, and their dodekatemorion [twelfth-part] toward Zeus. And because the foundation chart concerning the beginning of the voyage was found to be obscure, the Lot of Fortune being in Sagittarius where Argo rises, and its ruler also being in a cadent sign, and seeing the Ascendant in Gemini and the lord of the Ascendant separating, and the lady of the Midheaven, Aphrodite, in Gemini, and the ruler of Fortune in Gemini, and the receiver, the lord of the Lot of Fortune, in Gemini, and the steward of the Moon in Gemini, I said that these would go from ship to ship. And because Aphrodite was “winged” according to Sagittarius, I said that they were carrying some winged things with them; and because the Moon was in the domicile of Ares and the bounds of Hermes, I said also that they were likely to be carrying some books or charts, and some bronze vessels because of Scorpio.

And seeing that Asclepius rises with the Moon, I said also that they were carrying medical instruments with them. As to when it ought to arrive, I said when the Moon was in Aquarius. They arrived, and when asked, related the slowness at sea; we know that a great storm arose and the sea was divided, the prow struck a rock and was broken, and they suffered greatly from the storm; but after entering a harbor, transferring the cargo to another ship, they finally arrived, bringing with them little winged sparrows and a plain chart because Hermes was separating, and cooking vessels because of Scorpio, and a medicine chest well-stocked because of Asclepius and Hygieia.

                                                                                 [F. C.]

G. 113 (236v). 6. Of Demetrius¹, concerning fugitives.

The Ascendant is the fugitive and also the time of his discovery; the Midheaven, the cause of the flight; the Descendant, the result for the fugitive; the lower heaven [imum coeli], the region to which he is carried off and where he is likely to remain. If, then, someone flees with Aries rising, he will be found—

¹ Demetrius otherwise appears to be unknown.
