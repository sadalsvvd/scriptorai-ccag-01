Mars in Virgo at 8°, Jupiter in Aquarius at 8°, Venus in Gemini at 7°, Hermes (Mercury) in Leo, western (dyticus), separating (aphairetikos); the ascendant in Virgo at 2°, the midheaven in Taurus at 26°, the anabibazōn^1🤖 in Aries at 11°, the Lot of Fortune in Sagittarius at 29°.

Taking the significators for sailing and navigation—which were Saturn and Mars—and seeing again Saturn and Mars at the ascendant, and the Moon being carried toward Saturn, I then said that the ship had fallen into a great storm; but it was saved, because Venus and the Moon were under the aspect of Jupiter, their hebdomad (heptad)^2🤖 was moving toward Jupiter, and their dodekatemorion^3🤖 was toward Jupiter. And since the inception chart for the ship proved to be inconspicuous, the Lot of Fortune was in Sagittarius, where Argo rises, and its lord was in a "sleeping" (nocturnal)^4🤖 sign. Observing that the ascendant was in Gemini and its ruler was in a separating (aphairetikos)^5🤖 position, the ruler of the midheaven—Venus—was in Gemini, the ruler of Fortune was in Gemini, the receiver of the ruler of the Lot of Fortune was in Gemini, and the ruler of the Moon’s house was in Gemini, I said that these would transfer from one ship to another. Furthermore, because Venus was winged according to Sagittarius, I said they were carrying with them some birds; and because the Moon was in the house of Mars and in the bounds of Hermes (Mercury), I said it was likely they were also carrying with them some books or documents, and some bronze vessels because of Scorpio.

Seeing that Asclepius was rising together with the Moon, I said that they were also bringing medical instruments with them. As for when they should return, I said: when the Moon would be in Aquarius. They came back and, when questioned, recounted their delay at sea, stating that a great storm had arisen, the sea had parted, the prow struck a rock and was broken, and they suffered greatly from the storm; but after putting in to harbor, they transferred the cargo to another ship, and of the items they had brought with them, there were indeed small winged sparrows, a slender scroll because Hermes (Mercury) was separating, cooking vessels because of Scorpio, and a medicine chest filled by reason of Asclepius and Hygieia.

                                                                                 [F. C.]

G. 113 (236v). Section VI: From Demetrius¹, Concerning Runaways.

The ascendant signifies the runaway and the time of his discovery; the midheaven, the cause of the flight; the descendant (setting sign), the outcome for the one who has run away; the IC (lower or subterranean sign), to what region or climate he goes and where he is about to remain. If, then, someone runs away while Aries is ascending, he will be found—

¹ Demetrius otherwise appears to be unknown.
