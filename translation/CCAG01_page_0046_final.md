These are the chapters:
(f. 8) "On worldly outcomes from the book of Apomasar <sic>" ("Behold Saturn — rulers against rulers").
F. 8v. "On the eclipse of the Sun and Moon" ("When the Sun is eclipsed — the nature of the star").
F. 9. "Otherwise, about the same <sic>" ("The two luminaries we declare — significant matters").
F. 9v. "On the chronocrator" ("If perchance Saturn — prosperity everywhere").
F. 12v. "On the eclipse of the Moon" ("If there be an eclipse — the fishes").
