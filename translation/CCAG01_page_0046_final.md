Litg.*, 2nd ed., p. 630.—In this apotelesmatic book which we have examined, the precepts of Apomasar have been mingled by some compiler with doctrines borrowed from elsewhere.

^1🤖 “Apomasar” is a Graeco-Latinized form of Abu Maʿshar, a ninth-century Persian astrologer (787–885). The Greek “Ἀπομάσαρ” renders this Arabic name, and in this context refers to the author’s “book of outcomes (apotelesmata)”; “apotelesmatic” here denotes matters pertaining to astrological results or effects.
