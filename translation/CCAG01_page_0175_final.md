...and of treachery and of power and of every kind of villainy has become the proximate cause.  
But victory has become the proximate cause of faith and of good hope and of struggle and of all fellowship, and further also of enterprise and of success.  
Retribution of the chthonic spirits and things hidden, and also of exposure and of sloth and of flight and of ruin and of mourning and of the mode of death has become the proximate cause.  
The basis, which is the horoscope, has become the proximate cause of life and spirit, since at the very moment of birth, every being draws to itself from the air the vital spirit at the turning point of the hour of the descent, which is fixed according to the emergence, and which is a signifier of the whole.
