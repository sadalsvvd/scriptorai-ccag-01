...and of plots and of power and of all forms of wrongdoing is established as the cause.

Victory, on the other hand, is established as the cause of faith and good hope and contest and all fellowship, and furthermore, of initiative and success^1ðŸ¤–.

Retribution belongs to the underworld daimons and the hidden ones, and is established as the cause of revelation, inertia, flight, destruction, mourning, and the quality of death^2ðŸ¤–.

The "basis," which is the Ascendant (Horoskopos), is established as the cause of life and spirit, since at the very moment of birth everything that comes into being draws in the vital breath^3ðŸ¤– from the air at the appointed turning of the hour of condensation^4ðŸ¤–, which indicates the whole of things.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1ðŸ¤–. The phrase rendered as "furthermore, of initiative" translates the Greek "á¼”Ï„Î¹ Î´á½² ÎºÎ±Î¯," which can mean "furthermore," "even also," or "in addition;" the choice here preserves a sense of accumulating causes, and "initiative" reflects the original's nuance of active strivingâ€”alternatively, "effort" could be used.

2ðŸ¤–. "Revelation" here translates a Greek term that could also be rendered "exposure;" it refers to the bringing-to-light of hidden thingsâ€”a standard technical sense in astrological literature.

3ðŸ¤–. The phrase "vital breath" renders the Greek "Ï€Î½Îµá¿¦Î¼Î±," which can also mean "spirit." "Breath" is chosen here to emphasize the physiological aspect, but "spirit" is also a possible translation.

4ðŸ¤–. The phrase "at the appointed turning of the hour of condensation" translates a highly technical Greek astrological expression relating to the precise moment of birth. The term "condensation" (from Greek "ÏƒÏ„Î±Î»Î±Î³Î¼Î¯Î±") literally means "dripping" or "distillation," and is employed metaphorically for the critical instant when the vital principle is received. Other possible renderings include "the instillation hour" or "the assigned moment of descent."
