...the summer is fulfilled, which is fire. Again, when the sun enters Libra, a tropical sign of the zodiac, it causes the autumnal equinox, and from then the air inclines toward coolness; the night lengthens beyond the equal hours. Again, when the sun enters Scorpio, a solid sign of the zodiac, it makes the air of autumn more stable and unchanging, subtracting from the length of the day and adding to the length of the night. Again, when it enters Sagittarius, a double-bodied sign of the zodiac, it mixes the air and produces a temperament between autumn and winter; and further, it subtracts even more from the length of the day and adds to the length of the night. In this triadic sequence of zodiacal signs, therefore, autumn is completed, which is earth.

Again, when it enters Aquarius, a solid and wintry sign of the zodiac, it makes the air of winter more stable and unchanging, subtracting from the length of the night and adding to the length of the day. Again, when it enters Pisces, a double-bodied sign of the zodiac, it mixes the air and produces a temperament between winter and spring, subtracting from the length of the night and adding to the length of the day, until the equinoctial hours. In this triadic sequence of zodiacal signs, winter air is completed, which is water.
