EXCERPTS FROM CODEX 8 (Laur. 28, 44).

I have made these fragments of Hephaestion public, as if they were a foretaste of the entire work, which I intend to publish soon. These excerpts—with perhaps the exception of the last one—agree so exactly with the chapters, each marked at the end with our sign, of Book I as edited from the Parisian codices by Engelbrecht, that it confirms once more the opinion I have previously expressed (Stud. ital. etc., VI, 7): that the recension of the Parisian codices is by no means the sole genuine version, but is rather an epitome of the doctrine of this celebrated author.

Folio 42v.

27. Which of the twelve places are preferable?  
[in the margin: In which places the stars rejoice.]

Saturn rejoices in Aquarius, Jupiter in Sagittarius, Mars in Scorpio, Venus in Taurus, and Mercury in Virgo.

28. On the differentiation of the places.

Since there are twelve places^1🤖 arranged in order, the most eminent is the Ascendant, the second is the Midheaven, the third is that which lies in trine aspect to the Ascendant immediately after it, the fourth is the one preceding the Midheaven by a sextile aspect from the Ascendant, the fifth is that which is diametrically opposed to the Ascendant, that is, the Descendant, the sixth is the Lower Midheaven (Imum Coeli), the seventh is the one following the Midheaven, and the eighth is the one preceding the Midheaven; but the remaining places are by far the most baleful of all.

                [A. O.]

1 Cf. Heph. Theb. I, chaps. 7, 12—the former title applies to the second part, which we have marked and inscribed as 28. On the differentiation of the places (line 5), following the Parisian codices (Engelb.) as requested; the latter title (in the margin) refers to the former. — On the powers of the twelve places cf. Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos II, 18, and Paris codex 2506, folios 1ff. 4 <the masculine article “the”> supplied. 7 bʹon, 1 gʹon, 8 dʹon, 9 eʹon, 10 zʹon, 11 ēon in the codex; corrected by Kroll, i.e., the ninth place. 11–12 the Midheaven is here called the lower Midheaven [Kroll].

29. On lordship and co-lordship.

A planet among the five^2🤖 is called lord (*oikodespotes*) of a certain zodiacal sign; that is, the ruler which possesses the domicile of that sign. But one who additionally shares in this lordship, by having either exaltation or triplicity/trigon^3🤖 in the same sign, is called co-lord (*synoikodespotes*).

1 Cf. Heph. Theb., ibid. ch. 13. 2 <κύριος> "ruler" added by Kroll, comparing Hephaestion loc. cit. 3  αὐτῷ τῷ in the codex.


LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The Greek word "τόποι" (“places”) refers to the twelve astrological houses or loci in the traditional scheme, corresponding to positions in the zodiacal chart.

^2🤖 "The five" refers to the five non-luminary planets recognized in Hellenistic astrology—Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury—excluding the Sun and Moon.

^3🤖 The Greek term "τρίγωνον" (trigon or triplicity) is a technical term in ancient astrology. While "triangle" is a literal translation, here it refers to triplicity rulership—one of the forms of planetary dignity based on the set of signs sharing the same element. An alternative rendering: "by having either exaltation or triplicity rulership in the same sign."
