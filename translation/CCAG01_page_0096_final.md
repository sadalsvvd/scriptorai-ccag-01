EXCERPTS FROM CODEX 8 (Laur. 28, 44).

I have made these fragments of Hephaestion public, as a kind of foretaste of the complete work which I intend to publish very soon. These excerpts—with the possible exception of the last one—correspond, along with the headwords marked at the end of each of our entries, so well to Book I of the Paris manuscripts as edited by Engelbrecht, that the opinion I have previously set forth (Stud. ital. etc., VI, 7) is thereby confirmed anew: namely, that the recension of the Paris manuscripts is by no means the sole or authentic one, but rather an epitome of the doctrine of a most renowned author.

Folio 42v. 27. Which of the twelve places are better.  
[in the margin: In which places the stars rejoice.]

Saturn rejoices in Aquarius, Zeus in Sagittarius, Mars in Scorpio, Aphrodite in Taurus, Hermes in Virgo.

28. On the differences of the places.

Since there are twelve astrological houses (places) arrayed, the most excellent is the Ascendant (horoscopus), second is the Midheaven, third is that which is placed trigonally next after it in relation to the Ascendant, fourth is the one preceding the Midheaven, distant by a hexagonal aspect from the Ascendant, fifth is that which is opposite the Ascendant, that is, the Setting, sixth is the lower Midheaven (i.e. hypogeion), seventh is that which follows the Midheaven, and eighth is the one preceding the Midheaven; but the remaining ones are all especially the most baneful.

1 Cf. Heph. Theb. I, chs. 7, 12 — the former title refers to the second part, which, following the Paris manuscripts (Engelb.), we have also designated and inscribed as 28. On the differences of the places (l. 5), at the request; the second title (in the margin) refers to the former. — On the powers of the twelve places, cf. Ptolemy, Tetrabiblos II, 18, and cod. Paris. 2506, fol. 1 sqq. 4 “Aphrodite” supplied. 7 second, 1 third, 8 fourth, 9 fifth, 10 seventh, 11 eighth in the codex; emended by Kroll, i.e. the ninth place. 11–12 “Midheaven” here means the lower (i.e. hypogeion) Midheaven [Kroll].

29. On house lordship and co-lordship.

A “house lord” is so called when one of the five stars, being the <ruler> of a zodiacal sign, holds domicile in that sign; but one who shares with him in the lordship of the house by virtue of holding in the same sign the exaltation or the triangle (trigon) is called “co-lord.”
