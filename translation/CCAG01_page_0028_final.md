from among the poorest of mortals, and this is also what the book of the Babylonians records.

F. 18. In brief, you will find, according to the desired Roman month of the current year, as well as the place and time of conjunctions and full moons, recalculated by new tables from those in the great compilation of Ptolemy concerning conjunctions and full moons, and also by tables of the anomaly of both the Sun and Moon; from which also a very concise method is derived, indicating in which conjunction there will be an eclipse of the Sun or Moon, at the request of certain individuals, so that it might form a single whole; then from these, also, concerning the regular and anomalous positions of the Sun at each season, but of the Moon only the regular.

The chapters are as follows:

αʹ. Method of the conjunctions and full moons; whose beginning is the method of the conjunctions (The conjunction and the full moon—concerning their latitude).

F. 18v.

βʹ. The time of the mean conjunction (And thus we have the time—from the moment in which the Sun is).

γʹ. Regular position of the Sun either at the conjunction, in which degree of the Zodiac it is, or also the regular position of the Moon is shown either at conjunction or its position at opposition at the full moon (The position of the Sun—from which we shall take the position).

F. 19.

δʹ. Concerning the exact position of the Sun at the regular conjunction (Introducing the parameters of the apogee—less than 180).

εʹ. What should be done when there are hours and minutes among the numbers given in the anomalies (When there are hours among the numbers given—we shall take the exact value).

ϛʹ. Concerning the exact position of the Moon at the regular conjunction (Introducing after this—the synodic period of days).

ζʹ. How one must find the place of the exact conjunction (If it differs—the opposition at the full moon).

F. 19v.

ηʹ. Determination of the hour of the conjunction (The exact time—that of the Sun will be added).

θʹ. Determination of the anomalous motion of the Moon by hour (At that time—we have the time).

F. 20.

ιʹ. Concerning the latitude of the Moon contributing to the completion of eclipses (The latitude of the Moon—ascent to the north).

ιαʹ. How at this point the present tropical point should be corrected in the conjunctions, that which is raised above the anomalous difference (Yet the hours—makes them distinct).

F. 20v.

ιβʹ. From where are the ecliptic limits, and in what numbers of the northern extremity there will be an eclipse (Of the northern extremity—of the known method).
