THE FLORENTINE MANUSCRIPTS  

from the poorest of mortals, and this is what the book of the Babylonians records.

F. 18. In summary form you will find, according to the required Roman month of the current year, the place and time of the syzygies^1🤖 and full moons, transformed by new canons^2🤖 from those in the great Compilation^3🤖 of Ptolemy on the syzygies and full moons, as well as by canons for the anomaly of both the Sun and the Moon. From these, a very concise method is presented, showing at which syzygy there will be an eclipse of the Sun or the Moon—this at the request of certain persons, so that it might become a single treatise. Then, from these also, concerning the uniform and anomalous^4🤖 [motions] of the Sun at each season, and of the Moon only in its uniform [motion].

The chapters are inscribed as follows.

α. Method for the syzygies and full moons; whose beginning is the method for the conjunctions (The syzygy and the full moon—of its latitude).

F. 18v.

β. Time of the mean syzygy (And thus we have the time—from the [degree] in which the Sun is).

γ. The uniform solar epoch or at the syzygy, in which degree of the Zodiac it is, or likewise the uniform lunar epoch, or at the syzygy, or the epoch of this [Moon], or at the opposition at the full moon (As for the Sun, its epoch—we will take the epoch).

F. 19.

δ. Concerning the precise solar epoch at the uniform syzygy (By inserting the [degrees] of apogee—less than 180).

ε. What should be done whenever there are hours and minutes in the numbers inserted in the anomalies (But whenever there are hours in the inserted numbers—we shall take the precise [value]).

ϛ. Concerning the precise lunar epoch at the uniform syzygy (Introducing after this—the summation of the days).

ζ. How one must find the place of the precise syzygy (If, however, there is a difference—the diameter at the full moon).

F. 19v.

η. Determination of the hour of the syzygy (But the precise time—to that of the Sun will be added).

θ. Determination of the lunar anomaly’s current hourly motion (Now at that time—we have the time).

F. 20.

ι. Concerning the latitude of the Moon in reference to the occurrence of eclipses (As for the latitude of the Moon—the northern ascent).

ια. How here the existing tropic must be corrected in the syzygies, the difference that increases by the anomalies (But the hours—it makes distinct).

F. 20v.

ιβ. Whence the limits of eclipses, and in what numbers, at the northernmost point, there will be an eclipse (As for the northernmost point—of the established method).

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Syzygy" (συζυγία) is a technical astronomical term referring to the alignment of celestial bodies, typically used for new and full moons, and is retained here for accuracy.
^2🤖 "Canons" (κανονίων) are technical tables or rules used in astronomical calculations, especially in the Ptolemaic and Byzantine tradition.
^3🤖 "Great Compilation" refers to the Almagest or similar works of Ptolemy; capitalization signals its status as a recognized scholarly treatise.
^4🤖 The terms "uniform and anomalous [motions]" translate the Greek ὁμαλῆς and ἀνωμάλου, which correspond to regular (mean) and irregular (apparent) astronomical motions. Retained in technical language with bracketed explanatory notes.
