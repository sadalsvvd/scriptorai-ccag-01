In Scorpio: When the Moon is in aspect to Saturn, most beneficially, whether through additive numbers or through light, it preserves.  
When the Moon is in aspect to Mars, subtractively with regard to light or also numbers, it is most beneficial, and it preserves in the first square or up to the diameter.  
When the Moon is in aspect to Mars, additively with regard to numbers, especially from conjunction, it brings about a test by iron; but if the Moon is also carried towards the Sun, it also produces abscesses around the ribs; but if it is also turned toward the greater [parts], that is, toward other [signs] longitudinally, it also causes incisions around the ribs and, through blood, makes blood flow from the nostrils.  
But if the Moon protracts as far as the diameter and so overshoots, it brings on chronic diseases and thus leads to danger.  
But if Jupiter or Venus is conjoined with the Moon, it will bring about the aforesaid conditions, but protects against chronic illness.  
When the Moon moves toward the inferior planets or even comes into conjunction, it causes inevitable paralysis and chronic diseases.

F. 17. On Crises and Diseases.

When considering diseases, observe both the horoscope of the crisis and the Moon’s position, the rulers of these, their applications, and the Moon’s affliction or lack of aspect.  
If benefic planets occupy these same places by lot, there will be no harm, and the disease will quickly subside,  
and health will follow; but if malefics hold these positions, harm and general affliction are indicated;  
in particular, if Mars obtains these, the disease will be on the right side and dangerous;  
but if Saturn, the disease becomes both chronic and severe;  
on the other hand, if only the Moon is seen to be afflicted by Saturn or Mars, the harm will be only concerning the body of the person;  
but if only the horoscope is afflicted, there will be madness and injury and disturbance of the mind;  
but if both places, that of the Moon and of the horoscope alike, are likewise afflicted by the malefics,  
and no benefic inspects them, the sign is inauspicious, you are in danger, and death is indicated.  
The particular region of the body where the disease will be, you will discern from the natural sympathy and affinity of the twelve zodiacal signs, as you learned in chapter 45.  
But if Saturn or Mars or—
