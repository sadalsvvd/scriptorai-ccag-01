In Scorpio: The Moon with Saturn, being especially benefic either by addition in numbers or especially in light, preserves.  
The Moon with Mars, subtractive in light or even in numbers, yet being especially benefic, preserves in the first square or up to the diameter.  
The Moon with Mars, additive in numbers, chiefly when in conjunction, brings about a trial of iron; and if she is directed also toward the Sun, she induces abscesses about the sides; and if she is also turned toward the greater parts, that is, toward the others along the length,^1🤖 she produces an incision about the ribs and, through the flow of blood, causes blood from the nostrils.  
But if she continues thus right up to the diameter and is carried beyond, she brings about chronic diseases and thus leads to danger.  
But if Zeus or Aphrodite contends together with the Moon, the imminent ailments it will bring about, but chronic ones it preserves.  
The Moon running toward the inferior planets, or also coming into conjunction with them, relaxes unerringly and brings about chronic ailments.

F. 17. On Crises and Diseases

When considering diseases, observe both the horoscope of the crisis and the transit of the Moon,  
as well as their lords; furthermore, also their conjunctions, and the opposition of the Moon.  
If the benefic planets are allotted the very same places, there will be no harm, but the disease will soon be dispersed  
and health will follow; but if malefics are allotted them, harm is indicated and also affliction in general.  
Specifically, if Mars is allotted these, the disease will be on the right side and dangerous;  
but if Saturn, the disease will become chronic and serious at the same time;  
but if the Moon alone appears afflicted by Saturn or Mars, the harm will exist only with respect to the person’s body;  
if only the horoscope is afflicted, there will be madness and harm to the intellect, and derangement;  
but if both places, that of the Moon and of the horoscope, are likewise afflicted by the malefics,  
and no benefic inspects them, the sign is unfavorable and you are in danger, even of death.  
As to what region of the body the disease will affect, you will learn from the natural sympathy  
and affinity of the twelve signs, as you learned in the forty-fifth chapter.^2🤖

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 The phrase "toward the greater parts, that is, toward the others along the length" (ἐπὶ τὰ μείζονα τραπήται, τοὐτέστιν ἐπὶ τὰ ἄλλα κατὰ μῆκος) may refer to major limbs or longitudinal body regions, contrasting with the sides/ribs. It is ambiguous and likely anatomical, not planetary.
2. ^2🤖 The "forty-fifth chapter" refers to the section in the text (chapter 45) detailing the sympathy and affinity between zodiac signs and regions of the body.
