...of decumbiture; for from these it is possible to find the most pertinent outcomes, as well as anything omitted on account of the length of the treatise.

F. 20. A method by numbers for predicting whether the patient will survive in health, remain in danger, or die.

And for the sake of clarity, let us first present the division of days indicated to mortals by Hermes; after this follow the methods discovered by Petosiris and Pythagoras. Thus, Hermes Trismegistus advises to count from the rising of the Dog-Star—that is, Epiphi 25 according to the Alexandrians—up to the day of decumbiture, and to divide the resulting number by 36; then, observe the remainder in the following canon, to see in which line and in which direct element it falls. For zeta (ζ, 7) indicates life, kappa (κ, 20) danger, and theta (θ, 9) death.
[A. O.]

F. 22v. Beginnings according to Zenarion¹.

Let it also be set forth, according to Zenarion, how certain persons determine the beginnings so as not to be deceived, each according to their own method; for having found the day of the conjunction in Cancer, they count from that day up to the desired day, and the total they divide by 7, resolving the remainders one by one: the first to Kronos (Saturn), second to Ares (Mars), third to Aphrodite (Venus), fourth to Selene (Moon), fifth to Zeus (Jupiter), sixth to Helios (Sun), seventh to Hermes (Mercury); and whichever number it falls to, this one, they say, rules and contends for the day. The ruler of the hour of the beginning is taken likewise: the first hour is assigned to the very one contending, the second as follows: if, for instance, Kronos is contending, Kronos is given the first hour, Selene the second, Hermes the third, Ares the fourth, Helios the fifth, Aphrodite the sixth, Zeus the seventh; in the same way, the eighth again to Kronos, and so on for the rest according to the aforementioned order of the rulers. If Ares is contending, then in the same order, likewise.
