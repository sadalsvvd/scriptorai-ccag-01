¹ Extant in the imperial library (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, Cod. 134 and 135) is the commentary of Heliodorus on the astrological doctrine of Paul, divided into fifty-three chapters. It is also found in the library of St. Mark’s, Venice (cod. 324; cf. Fabricius-Harles, IV, p. 152). Excerpts from this commentary are not infrequently noted (see Kroll, Philologus, 1898, p. 129), e.g., in codices Marc. 335, f. 244r, 356r; Marc. 336, f. 278r; Turin, CVIII, 10, f. 7. See also Vienna, Cod. 47 (Lambecius, Commentarii, vol. VIII, p. 193), Paris, BnF, cod. 2419, f. 140v, Naples II, c. 33, f. 521v; and below, cod. 12, f. 164. On the date of Heliodorus, see also cod. 11, f. 261.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase “the hexagonal figure is beneficial—or according to the body” reflects the ambiguity of the Greek “ἢ δὲ κατὰ σῶμα,” which could mean “the hexagonal figure is good—in the case of the body,” or “the hexagonal figure is beneficial, or (this is so) according to the body.” The translation preserves this uncertainty.

^2🤖 The term “sown” here renders the Greek “σπόριμος,” a technical astrological designation for a particular degree or condition associated with sowing or being “sown;” see footnote for more on its specialized meaning.
