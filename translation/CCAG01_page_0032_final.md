¹ There exists in the Imperial Library (Vienna 134 and 135) a commentary of Heliodorus on the astrological doctrine of Paul, divided into fifty-three chapters. There is also one in the Venetian Library of St. Mark, codex 324 (see Fabricius-Harles, IV, p. 152). Excerpts from this commentary are noted by Kroll (Philologus, 1898, p. 129) as not infrequently found, e.g., in codices Marc. 335, f. 244r, 356r; Marc. 336, f. 278r; Turin, CVIII, 10, f. 7. Add Vienna, 47 (Lambecius, Comment., vol. VIII, p. 193), Paris 2419, f. 140v, Naples II, c. 33, f. 521v, and see below, codex 12, f. 164. — On the date of Heliodorus, cf. below, at codex 11, f. 261.
