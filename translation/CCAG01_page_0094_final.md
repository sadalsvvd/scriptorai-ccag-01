The total duration of these years is three hundred sixty-five days and a quarter; this quarter, in every four years, is completed into a full day. That day, in the month of Subat (that is, February), they add; hence, that year has three hundred sixty-six days. This is called “kapisā,”^1🤖 which the Romans call “bissextile”; but those years which do not have an added day are called “pasitā.”^2🤖 The beginning of this year is the second day, which is also the beginning of their month Tishri; and some count the beginning of that year from the sixth day. But the name of that month is Adar,^3 because it is in this month that the beginning of the world is renewed, that is, takes its origin. For this reason also Patanēs^4 set the course of the stars according to this year, establishing its beginning from Adar.

The fourth year: this is how the Persians reckon, because the beginning of this year is counted from the time when Muhammad journeyed from Mecca to Medina. The beginning of this year is the seventh day, and the beginning of the month Muharram; and this is what the Arabs call by that name. Their years are lunar years: the year is three hundred fifty-four days and twenty-two minutes^5🤖; thus, the twenty minutes in three years accumulate into a day, and the two minutes in thirty years accumulate into another day, so that in thirty years there are eleven surplus days. Therefore, in thirty years, eleven years are “kapisā,” and that “kapisā” year is three hundred fifty-five days;^6 the other years, each being three hundred fifty-four days, are called for them “pasitā.”^7

The months of this year are counted in two ways: the Persians count each month separately; but others begin their count from the sighting of the new moon.^8 After this reckoning, there is a period during which three months each have twenty-nine days, and another period in which four months each have thirty days; this they call the “roiatukhillai reckoning.”^9 For this reason, there is no fixed order. Astronomers, however, from the start of the year, assign thirty days to the first month, twenty-nine to the next, and so on counting alternately until the year is complete; and they call this reckoning “ampri ausat.”^10 All the tables use this reckoning. After this and the first reckoning, three days are lacking.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “kapisā” is a technical term (Syriac: kbisha) for the intercalary or leap year, used here in contrast to the Roman “bissextile.”  
^2🤖 “pasitā” (Syriac: pshīlā) refers to the “simple” or ordinary year, i.e., without an intercalated day.  
^3 “Adar” is the name corresponding to the month of March in the Syriac calendar.  
^4 Patanēs refers to al-Battānī (Albategnius), the noted medieval astronomer.  
^5🤖 The original and most critical editions note that technically, the lunar year should be “three hundred fifty-four days, eight hours, and forty-eight minutes.” The “twenty-two minutes” is a simplified or possibly corrupt reading.  
^6🤖 Some manuscripts or editions mistakenly give a total of 365 days; the correct value for a lunar leap year is 355 days.  
^7🤖 “kapisā” and “pasitā” refer respectively to “intercalary” and “simple” years in both Syriac and Arabic calendar traditions.  
^8🤖 The reference to beginning the count with “the sighting of the new moon” reflects the observation-based reckoning of the Islamic calendar.  
^9🤖 The terminology “roiatukhillai” is corrupt in the manuscripts and its precise meaning is uncertain, but it refers to a cycle alternating between months of 29 and 30 days.  
^10 The “ampri ausat” reckoning assigns 30 and 29 days alternately to months to approximate the lunar year, as used in astronomers’ tables.
