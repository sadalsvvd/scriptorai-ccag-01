and the whole period of these is three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter; and this quarter, in every fourth year, completes one day. That day, in the month of Sumbat, that is, February, they add; hence that year is three hundred and sixty-six days; and this is called "kapisa," which the Romans call "bissextile." But those years which do not have this added day are called "pasita." Therefore, the beginning of this year is the second day, which is also the beginning of their month Tashri. But some reckon the beginning of that year from the sixth; and the name of that month among them is Adar, on account of this: because the renewal, or the beginning, of the world is reckoned in this month. For this reason also, Patani* (i.e., al-Battānī, also known as Albategnius) has established the course of the stars for his conjunction in this year and has set the beginning of his year from Adar.

The fourth year: this the Persians reckon, since the beginning of this year is counted from the time when Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina. And the beginning of this year is the seventh day, as is also the beginning of the month Muharram; and thus this name is what the Arabs call it; and their years are lunar years, being three hundred and fifty-four days and eight hours and forty-eight minutes; these eight hours, in every three years, amount to one day; and in thirty years the forty-eight minutes make up one day, so that in thirty years there are eleven extra days; it happens, then, in thirty years, eleven years are intercalated ("kapisa"); and that leap year has three hundred and fifty-six days. The rest of the years, being three hundred and fifty-four days, are called by them "pasita." The months, therefore, of this year are calculated in two ways: the Persians count by single months; but others reckon the beginning (of the count) from when they see the new moon. According to this reckoning, there occurs a period in which three months have each twenty-nine days, and another period in which four months have each thirty days; this they call "the count of roiatuquilla"; for this reason, they are not in a single order. But the astronomers, from the beginning of the year, count the first month as having thirty days, the next after it as having twenty-nine, and so count alternately until the end of the year; and this count they call "ampri ausat"; and the computation of all conjunctions is according to this count. But after this count and the first, it happens that three days are lacking
