APPENDIX

They sailed amid evils and found means also for swift time;  
the sign of life sets, and gave grievous† misfortunes without hearth.

Helios, determining the hour.  
Helios, passing through in a circle with the voice of his ray†,  
having entered the speed of the hour, gives bright days,  
chiefly appearing to many among the male signs of the zodiac.  
He signified those possessing wealth  
and much pity in living creatures over time; but if he mingles with evils,  
his appearance wanes again, yet he is fine  
for father and livelihood, and he releases reckless misfortunes.

Kronos, determining the hour.  
But if Kronos observes, holding the sting according to his lot, as the time-determiner,  
he is bad, and baser at night;  
he sends orphanhoods, delusions, tightly bound misfortunes,  
and to sufferings he adds manifold calamity†;  
he cast upon the sick and dying a contentious star, the bringer of war to mortals;  
for dreadful is Kronos’s course revealed amid snows†.

Zeus, determining the hour.  
Zeus, supremely divine, is far better as a time-determiner by day;  
he is much stronger then; but if he travels by night,  
he is neither bad nor indeed good†—his most radiant light appears—  
he grants to a few, in middling times, well-composed men;  
in old age, at night, may the nightly star bring decline†.  
But if, rejoicing in bright Olympus, he travels,  
men are always fortunate and prominent, especially in the homeland;  
but if an evil comes to him without proper ritual,  
he inflicts dreadful sufferings on the wretched, sending many woes.

Ares, determining the hour.  
Ares, holding the greatest sting of the time-determiner,  
armored in valor, gave gifts wrought in gold,  
magnified wealth for men; but they, not restraining from past excess,  
do not release grievous sufferings of the soul.  
At night, he is much stronger, appearing among males.
