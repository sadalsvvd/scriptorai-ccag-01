APPENDIX

They sailed even amidst hardships, and found swift passage of time;  
the sign of life sets, and unmixed miseries it has given.^1🤖

The Sun as Time-Lord.  
The Sun, measuring the hours, runs on encircling with the cry of his ray,^2🤖  
and, having fixed the speed of the hour, he grants fair days,  
especially appearing to many among the masculine signs,^3🤖  
he signified those possessing wealth  
and much mercy in living things for a span of time; but if among the evil  
he comes together in aspect, the reputation is lessened—save that he is noble,  
and brings good to father and livelihood, and loosens reckless woes.

Saturn as Time-Lord.  
But if Saturn gazes, holding the sting^4🤖 by lot  
in governing the hours, he is baleful, and even worse by night,  
dispatching orphanhoods, doom, and evilly-bound woes,^5🤖  
and many-tangled excesses of afflictions he is wont to send forth,  
and to the sick and perishing he has brought warfare as a star;  
for terribly, with Saturn's snow,^6🤖 his course is announced.

Zeus as Time-Lord.  
And Zeus, much-honored god, far superior in governing hours,  
is much more excellent by day; but if he journeys by night,  
not evil, nor yet good—a most radiant light appeared,  
for short spans he produces decent men in the middle rank,^7🤖  
but in old age he grants the deprivation which is the star of night.^8🤖  
But if, rejoicing in bright Olympus, he journeys onward,  
fortunate and always preeminent they become, most of all in their homeland;  
but if evil overtakes him in his incursion without share,  
he brings dreadful sorrows, dispatching many grievous woes.

Ares as Time-Lord.  
But Ares, holding the greatest sting^9🤖 of the time-lord,  
donned in strength, gave golden-working gifts,  
increased the wealth for men, but these did not  
make sovereign nor resolve great sorrows of soul;  
by night he is much superior, especially among the masculine signs.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1🤖 The opening lines are obscure, with debated manuscript readings; the rendering preserves the ambiguity and abruptness of the Greek.  
2🤖 "Cry of his ray": "βοῇ ἀκτῖνι" can mean "cry" as both a sound and a metaphor for brightness or radiance; the phrase keeps the poetic ambiguity of the original.  
3🤖 "Masculine signs": This preserves astrological and grammatical ambiguity, denoting the Sun's favorable influence in masculine zodiacal signs and possibly among men.  
4🤖 "Sting": "κέντρον" is an astrological metaphor for planetary influence, often implying affliction or intensity.  
5🤖 "Evilly-bound woes": "κακοείρετα πήματα" maintains the structure and compound sense in the Greek, denoting woes tightly bound with evil.  
6🤖 "Saturn's snow": "νιφαδέσσι Κρόνου" is metaphorical for Saturn's calamitous nature; the translation retains this poetic imagery.  
7🤖 "Decent men in the middle rank": "μεσοστύχους" is ambiguous, possibly "men of middle rank" or those in the "midst" between extremes (see critical apparatus).  
8🤖 The phrase about deprivation in old age under the "star of night" is corrupt and ambiguous; the rendering preserves the possible double sense of loss and death.  
9🤖 "Greatest sting": Again, "κέντρον" here refers to the strength or impact of Mars' rulership, retaining the technical astrological term.
