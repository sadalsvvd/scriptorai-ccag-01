LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Mutilated” here refers to a manuscript that is defective or incomplete; the original Latin term is “mutilus.”  
^2🤖 “Affinities” translates Latin “Affinitates,” indicating relationships or similarities between manuscripts, as opposed to administrative affiliations.  
^3🤖 The abbreviations S. (scribes/authors) and P. (possessors/owners) appear in parentheses after each name to mirror the original listing and preserve clarity.  
^4🤖 “Ioannes ho Abramios” (also rendered “Ioannes the Abramian”): The Greek construction is retained, with a suggested English equivalent in parentheses.  
^5🤖 “Count Giovanni Mirandolano” translates “Comes Iohannes Mirandulanus”; Pico della Mirandola and his family are likely intended, but this is kept general to preserve ambiguity.  
^6🤖 Biblioteca shelfmarks and designations are fully expanded at first occurrence for clarity, and commonly accepted library names (e.g., “Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana,” “Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze”) are used in line with scholarly convention.
