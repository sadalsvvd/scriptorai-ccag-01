Gemini, 1 degree; Taurus, in quadrature, 1 degree; Aries, in trine, 1 degree; and the whole hemisphere above the earth. On the left, Virgo, in hexagon, 30 degrees; Libra, in quadrature, 30 degrees; Scorpio, in trine, 30 degrees; and the whole hemisphere below the earth.

Therefore, the right-hand figures are those among the leading signs, from whatever part of the Zodiac, and the left-hand those that follow.

23. On the doryphory (accompaniment) of the stars.¹

Doryphory occurs when, in its own house or exaltation, a star is at the angular point, and another, also in its own house or exaltation, casts a ray—such as, for example, when Venus is in Libra and Saturn is in Capricorn: she will be ray-cast by Saturn; or, again, if Saturn is in Libra, Venus will cast a ray to him from Capricorn; or Mars, or again, in place of Saturn, Venus; or again, Jupiter from Sagittarius and Venus in Libra; or when the stars are arranged conversely, at the ascendant or at the midheaven: in a diurnal nativity, a diurnal planet will act as an attendant, and in a nocturnal nativity, a nocturnal one—even if both the attendant and the attended are in another’s house or exaltation; or whenever a luminary is at the angle of the ascendant or the midheaven, even if the planet of the sect is in another’s house, it will cast a ray—the Sun to the aforementioned degree, the Moon to the next; for example, when at the ascendant the Moon is present, Venus from Virgo or from Libra will cast a ray; thus, doryphory is said to occur whenever, with the Sun or the Moon at the angle, a planet of the sect acts as an attendant.

24. On attendant planets contrary to sect.

Contrarily, attendant planets function contrary to sect when the diurnal ones act as attendants for the nocturnal ones and the nocturnal ones for the diurnal.

25. On harmony.

The doryphories in trine and in quadrature are harmonious with each other and with others; those in hexagon operate more weakly.

¹ Doryphory (Greek: doryphoria) is the technical term in Hellenistic astrology for the accompaniment of a planet by others in certain configuration, typically by aspect or position; see further Porphyry p. 190 sq. and Hephaestio I, 17, who, as Engelbrecht notes, borrows from Porphyry.
