Gemini, 1°; the square is Taurus, 1°; the trine is Aries, 1°; and the entire hemisphere above the earth. On the left, the hexagon is Virgo, 30°; the square is Libra, 30°; the trine is Scorpio, 30°; and the entire hemisphere beneath the earth.

Therefore, right-hand (dexia) configurations are as many as occur among the preceding signs from whatever part of the Zodiac, and left-hand (aristera) configurations are those that follow.

23. On the Attendance (Doruphoria) of the Stars

“Doruphoria” (“attendance by satellites”^1🤖) occurs whenever a star is in its own domicile or exaltation at the center and another, likewise in its own domicile or exaltation, casts its rays—for example, when Venus is in Libra and Saturn in Capricorn, Saturn will cast its rays upon Venus; or again, when Saturn is in Libra, Venus will cast her rays upon Saturn from Capricorn. Similarly, Mars, or in place of Saturn, Venus; or again, Zeus (Jupiter) from Sagittarius and Venus in Libra; or in the reverse arrangement, if the stars are situated at the Ascendant (horoskopos) or the Midheaven (mesouranēma)—if the birth is diurnal, the attendant is diurnal; if nocturnal, the attendant is nocturnal—even if both the attending and the attended are in a domicile or exaltation not their own. Or, whenever a luminary is at the Ascendant or the Midheaven as the central planet, even if the attendant star happens to be in a domicile not its own, the Sun will cast its rays into the previously mentioned degree, the Moon into the latter; for example, concerning the Ascendant when the Moon is present, Venus will cast her rays from Virgo or from Libra. In brief, “attendance” (doruphoria) is said to occur whenever, with the Sun or Moon acting as the central planet, a star of the sect provides the attendance.

24. On Attendance Contrary to Sect (par’ hairesin)

There is “attendance contrary to sect” (par’ hairesin) whenever diurnal stars attend upon nocturnal ones and nocturnal stars attend upon diurnal ones.

25. On Congruence

Attendances by trine and by square (quartile) are more congruent than the others, for those by hexagon are more lax in their effect.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. “Doruphoria” is a technical term in Hellenistic astrology (from the Greek δωρουροφορία), commonly translated as “attendance,” “escorting,” or “presence by satellites,” and refers to the dynamic where one star supports or accompanies another via aspect, typically from its own domicile or exaltation. Some translate as “escort,” but “attendance” is standard.
