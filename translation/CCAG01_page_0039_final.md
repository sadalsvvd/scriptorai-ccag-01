**LLM Translation Footnotes**

^1🤖 The Greek "χρόιων καὶ ὕλων" can also be read as "complexions and materials," or "colors and materials." "Substances" is chosen here to cover both physical and elemental interpretations in astrological context.

^2🤖 "Pivots, returns, and declinations" translates Greek technical terms ("κέντρων," "ἐπαναφορῶν," "ἀποκλιμάτων") referring to pivotal chart points and planetary movements in Greek astrology.

^3🤖 "Exegetical Tetrabiblos" reflects "ἐξηγηματικῆς τετραβίβλου," denoting a paraphrase or commentary upon Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos; "Exegetical" is standard in scholarly literature, though "Didactic" may appear elsewhere.

^4🤖 The sequence "μʼ, ιθʼ, κʼ, χʼ, κβʼ, βʼ, νʼ, γʼ" is preserved as Greek numerals with Arabic numerals in parentheses for clarity. Their interpretive significance is technical and may relate to astronomical calculations.

^5🤖 The Greek term (συνάψεις) can mean both "conjunctions" and "bonds;" "conjunctions" is used as standard astrological English, but "bonds" is also seen in some scholarly renditions.
