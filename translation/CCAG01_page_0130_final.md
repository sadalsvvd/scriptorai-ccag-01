CODICES FLORENTINI

When it accompanies, it produces chills, cold sensations, rheumatic pains, spasms of the nerves, and suffering; but if Mars takes possession of these, he brings about fevers, heat, thirst, and dryness. Often, when Mars is in this position, by causing bleeding from the nose, he resolves the crisis of the disease and benefits the patient. But if, at the onset of the illness, the Moon is found increasing in numbers (additive phase)^1🤖 and forming an aspect with the Sun or with Mars, know that on the seventh or the nineteenth day—namely, when she forms a square or an opposition to herself^2🤖—the situation will be very critical and dangerous for the patient, and death is not far off. But if, under these circumstances, Saturn testifies to her and to the Sun, he becomes beneficial; but if, while the Moon is decreasing in numbers (waning)^3🤖 at the onset and Saturn forms an aspect, he becomes harmful to the patient; if in such a case Mars oversees her, he becomes beneficial. But if, after passing through her phases (aspects), the Moon comes again to her own square or aspect, and Saturn then oversees her, if it is at the good signs or at the beginning, he becomes the cause of the patient's recovery; but if it is at the worst manifesting signs and Saturn, in the square or opposition aspect, assails her, he becomes the cause of death for the patient and destroys him^4🤖.

F. 18. Another Consideration, in the margin: Concerning the sick

Let the Ascendant^5🤖 be the physician, the Midheaven the patient, the Descendant the illness, and the Lower Midheaven the therapy. If, then, the Ascendant is occupied by a malefic, the physician will be of no help to the patient, but will even harm him; but if a benefic occupies the Ascendant, the physician will help the patient, and if a benefic is present, even apart from the physician, the illness will spontaneously subside. If a malefic occupies the Ascendant, but a benefic is in the Lower Midheaven, this signifies that the original physician, even if he is most knowledgeable, cannot benefit the patient, but another physician coming later will help. Furthermore, concerning what is beneath the angular points, observe the star that follows it: whether it is in its own domicile (throne)^6🤖 or not; if...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Increasing in numbers (additive phase)"—the Greek 'προσθετικὴ τοῖς ἀριθμοῖς' refers to the Moon waxing, i.e., moving from new to full, a technical astrological term.  
^2🤖 The seventh and nineteenth days refer to the Moon forming a square (first quarter, day 7) or opposition (full moon, day 14; here day 19 possibly from a different counting) to its position at illness onset—critical moments in Hippocratic/astrological medicine.  
^3🤖 "Decreasing in numbers (waning)"—Greek 'ἀφαιρουσῆς ... τοῖς ἀριθμοῖς'—means the Moon is waning, moving from full to new.  
^4🤖 "Assails" translates the Greek 'ἐπικακέυῃ', a technical astrological verb meaning to cast harmful influence by aspect.  
^5🤖 The "Ascendant" (Greek ὡροσκόπος) is the sign rising at the eastern horizon at the moment in question; it is a standard technical term in astrology and more precise than "horoscope" or "rising sign."  
^6🤖 "Domicile (throne)"—Greek ἰδιοθρονεῖ, a technical term meaning the planet or star is in its own sign (zodiacal house), conferring strength or dignity in astrological doctrine.
