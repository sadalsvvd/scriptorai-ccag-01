If Saturn accompanies, he brings on chills, coldness, fluxes, convulsions of the nerves, and pains; but if Mars is allotted these, he produces fevers, heat, thirst, and dryness; and often, when Mars thus occurs, by causing a nosebleed, he has resolved the disease and benefitted the patient. But if, at the onset of the illness, the Moon is additive by the numbers and is in aspect to the Sun or to Mars, know that on the seventh or nineteenth day, that is, when she forms a square or an opposition to herself, the situation will be very precarious and dangerous for the patient, and death is not far off. But if, with all other things thus, Saturn testifies to her and to the Sun, he turns out beneficial; but if, while the Moon is subtractive by the numbers at the onset, Saturn is in aspect, he becomes harmful to the patient; but if, with her thus situated, Mars observes her, he becomes beneficial; but if, as the Moon in her passage through the figures comes to her own square or aspect and Saturn observes her—if it is at the aforementioned good indications or at the beginning—he becomes the cause of recovery for the patient; but if, at the worst manifesting signs, and Saturn, in the square or <diameter> aspect, directs the Moon toward himself, he becomes the cause of death for the patient and destroys him.

Let the physician be indicated by the Ascendant, the patient by the Midheaven, the disease by the triangle, and the therapy by the Imum Coeli. If, therefore, a malefic is at the Ascendant, the physician will not benefit the patient at all, but the patient will even be harmed by him; but if a benefic is at the Ascendant, the physician will benefit the patient, [and if a benefic is present] or even the disease will resolve spontaneously without the physician. However, if a malefic is at the Ascendant and a benefic is at the Imum Coeli/angular point, it shows that the first physician, even if he is most learned, can in no way benefit the patient, but another physician coming later will benefit him. As to “under the angles,” examine which star follows him, whether it is in its own throne or not; if—
