APPENDIX

And both Zeus and Aphrodite, who are the rulers of the city, being brought back to the Ascendant, you will find the beginnings of power to be noble and useful and worthy of every praise. But again, if you search out the lord of the Lot of Fortune and of the Moon, you will find Saturn fallen and reduced to the condition of eclipse; it was he who brought about the overthrow with hubris. But his quick succession was brought about by Mars and the Ascendant and the Moon, having encountered him in a tropical sign and in places of little strength. His being harmed was first prepared by the lord of the Lot of Fortune having fallen and by Mars; Zeus and Aphrodite established the matter of the city, themselves being brought back to that same Ascendant; he was moreover solitary and insolent on account of the nature of Mars, who was, by accidental position, ruler of the Ascendant.

F. 107 (226χ). 38. On Runaways. Of Serapion.

Whenever the Moon or the Ascendant is in tropical signs or in double-bodied signs and is testified to by malefics, the runaways will be found quickly; but if they are in fixed signs or under bonds, they are found slowly, and sometimes they are killed. If, however, they are witnessed by benefics, they are not found, especially if, having run away, they are in fixed signs or under a bond. And in all such cases you must use the Moon as the starting-point, and also the planet that rules and presides, and the hour, and the lord of the hour, according as I have already set out for you at the beginning of the methods concerning inceptions, and the inception will be well situated for you.

Ibid. 39. Of the Same, On Confinements or Relapses.

You must observe the Moon, the Ascendant, and Hermes (Mercury): by whom they are witnessed, and from whom the Moon has separated. For separation refers to what has already happened; conjunction refers to the release or completion; and always you will find that in cases of confinements or relapses such events arise from affliction of the Moon or also the Ascendant or also Hermes. There is also a distinction in the types of affliction; for...

v. 2 ff. In the margin, in the same hand but in brighter red ink: If, at the hour of the relapse, the Moon and the Ascendant are surrounded by malefics, and none of the benefics has any relation to the Moon or the Ascendant, the sign is deadly. The malefics alone bring about this effect, once they have obtained supremacy in the figures. 3 τε: manuscript has δὲ, corrected by Kroll. 5 ὁλοκληρώσεως in place of ὁλοκληρία, said in the likeness of the word κλήρωσις (“allotment”).
