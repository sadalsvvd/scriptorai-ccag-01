APPENDIX

Both Zeus and Aphrodite, the tutelary deities of the city, being brought back to the ascendant, you will find the beginnings of the reign to be noble and serviceable and worthy of all praise. But again, if you seek out the lord of the Lot of Fortune and of the Moon, you will find Saturn to be set aside and fallen into an eclipsed condition^1🤖; it was he who brought about the deposition with violence. The swiftness of his succession was brought about by Mars and the ascendant and the Moon, when they happened to be in a tropical sign and of little support^2🤖. And it was first the lord of the Lot of Fortune, being set aside, and Mars who prepared his loss. Jupiter and Aphrodite, recurring to the same ascendant of the city, accomplished the city’s [fate]. He was also solitary and arrogant due to the nature of Mars, who was attendant at the ascendant contrary to choice.

F. 107 (226χ). 38. On the Escapes of Slaves, by Serapion.

If, at the time of the Moon or the ascendant being in tropical signs or also in double-bodied ones, and being witnessed by malefic stars, they escape, they will soon be found; but if [they escape] in fixed signs or under bonds^3🤖, they are found slowly, and sometimes are killed. But if they are witnessed by beneficent stars, they are not found, especially if in fixed signs or under a bond when they escape. And in all such cases, make use of the Moon at the start, and of the ruler and governor, and of the hour and its lord, just as I set out for you regarding commencements in the beginning of the Methods, and the inception will be favorable for you.

5 ἐσθ’ ὅτε, instead of ἢ ὅτι in the manuscript. 10 For “just as...I set out,” cf. above 10* v. 1 seq. 9 “Methods” suspect.

Ibid. 39. Of the same, concerning confinements or installations^4🤖.

One must observe the Moon, the ascendant, and Hermes, by whom they are witnessed, and from what the Moon has separated. For separation indicates what has already happened, but coming together refers to release or completion; in all such cases, you will observe, for confinements or installations, that such a condition arises from the affliction of the Moon or also of the ascendant or also of Hermes. There is, however, a difference in affliction; for also—

v. 2 ff. In the margin, by the same hand but in brighter red: “If, at the time of the installation, the Moon and the ascendant should be controlled by malefics, and none of the benefics has any connection to the Moon or the ascendant, the sign is deadly. But the malefics bring destruction only when they have gained control by a majority of configurations.” 3 τε in the manuscript, corrected to δὲ by Kroll. 5 “completion” is said in place of “wholeness,” by analogy with the word κλήρωσις.

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 "fallen into an eclipsed condition" translates Greek phrase indicating a state of debility or being overshadowed, common in ancient astrological technical language.
2. ^2🤖 "of little support" renders ὀλιγαναφόροις, meaning literally "with few supporters" or "bringing little benefit," indicating weakness or lack of positive influence in the context.
3. ^3🤖 "bonds" likely translates δεσμοί, a technical astrological term for planetary bonds or connections, distinct from general "aspects."
4. ^4🤖 "concerning confinements or installations": The Greek covers events such as imprisonments, initiations, or institutionalizations; "installations" may also be interpreted as "commencements" or "inceptions" depending on context.
