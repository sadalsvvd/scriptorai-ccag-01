APPENDIX

I shall set forth. Here, let it suffice to preface a few remarks concerning the manuscripts that I have either examined or collated. Of these, by far the oldest and most excellent is

L = Laurentianus XXVIII, 34 (fol. 84r–93r). Titled:  
ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν ἐπίλυσις καὶ διήγησις πάσης ἀστρονομικῆς τέχνης.  
Apart from the proem, it contains 48 chapters, each with its own number, and, moreover, five additional chapters, regarding which one might perhaps doubt whether they are derived from the treasury of Rhetorius. Yet the latter part of chapter 51 and chapter 53 are attributed under Rhetorius's name in codex Monacensis 287, and in the codices Marcianus 336 and 324, chapters 52 and 53 are shown by their very order to be parts of the same treatise.  
Besides L, I have consulted the following manuscripts:

I. — a, p, q, f, m.

a = Laurentianus XXVII, 7 (15th cent.), fol. 170r–174v. Fol. 174v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

p = Monacensis 170 (16th cent., from the library of P. Victorius), pp. 75–84. Page 84:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου καὶ θεῶ δόξα.

q = Monacensis 105 (15th cent.), fol. 34r–40v. Fol. 40v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

f = Vaticanus 1444 (15th cent.), fol. 207r–212v. Fol. 212v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ Ῥητορίου.

These four manuscripts are very similar to each other. In all of them the book is entitled:  
Ῥητορίου ἔκθεσις καὶ ἐπίλυσις περὶ τε τῶν προειρημένων δώδεκα ζωδίων καὶ περὶ ἐτέρων διαφόρων ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν; likewise, they are preceded by the apotelesmatic introduction attributed to Rhetorius (Paulus Alexandrinus)^1🤖. Furthermore, they contain the same chapters: the proem (or, more precisely, the chapter which appears unnumbered before the first in codex L) and chapters 1, 3, 4, 7–10, 16, 17, 21, 23–44, 46, 47. I have collated codex q, which is not infrequently interpolated (see, for example, chapters 7 and 8) or defective; I have also occasionally inspected a and p.

From a manuscript of the same kind as a, p, q, f, the following was excerpted:  
m = Marcianus 335 (15th cent.) fol. 249v–251r (υμβ′–υνζ′, that is, chapters 42–47)^2🤖. It contains chapters 3, 4, 7 (mutilated), 8 (also mutilated), 17, 21, 23–44, 46, 47. The treatise of Antiochus is entitled in this manuscript:  
Ῥητορίου ἔκθεσις καὶ ἐπίλυσις περὶ τῶν ιβ′ ζωδίων καὶ περὶ ἐτέρων διαφόρων ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν.  
Fol. 251r:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

II. — n, o.

n = Marcianus 336 (15th cent.) fol. 228r ff. Contains chapters 1–3, 7–10, 12, 15–21, 23–44, 46–47, 48–53.

Exactly the same are found in the manuscript  
o = Marcianus 324 (15th cent.) fol. 127r–132r.

1 Cf. what precedes in codex Berolinensis described below.  
2 Besides these chapters, the same codex presents on fol. 112:  
περὶ σπορᾶς ἐκ τῶν ῥητορίου.  
Beginning: τοῦ ζωδιακοῦ εἰς τέ′ μοῖρας διηρημένου. Ending: δεῖ ζητεῖν τῆς συλλήψεως.  
The same is found in codex Parisinus 2506, which presents this chapter on fol. 23r. See on the matter Antiochus in Porphyry, p. 194, 8 sqq.; Hephaestion Thebanus, II, 1 (p. 24 Engelbrecht).



LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "apotelesmatic introduction" refers to a treatise on the predictive branch of astrology, often attributed in manuscripts to either Rhetorius or Paulus Alexandrinus; the precise authorship is debated among scholars.
^2🤖 Chapters are listed in Greek numeral notation (υμβ′–υνζ′); an English gloss is provided for clarity as "chapters 42–47."
