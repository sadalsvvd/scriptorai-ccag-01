APPENDIX

I will expound. Here it will suffice to preface a few remarks concerning the manuscripts which I have either inspected myself or collated. Of these, by far the oldest and most outstanding is

L = Laur. XXVIII, 34 (fols. 84r–93r). It is entitled:  
ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν ἐπίλυσις καὶ διήγησις πάσης ἀστρονομικῆς τέχνης.  
Apart from the proemium, it contains 48 chapters, each headed with its own number, and in addition five further chapters, about which you might perhaps doubt whether they are taken from the treasury of Rhetorius. However, the second part of chapter 51 and chapter 53 are attributed to Rhetorius in the Munich codex 287, and in Marcian codices 336 and 324, chapters 52 and 53 are shown to be parts of the same treatise by the actual order of the chapters.  
Besides L, I have examined these codices:

I. — a, p, q, f, m.

a = Laur. XXVII, 7 (15th century), fols. 170r–174v. Fol. 174v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

p = Munich 170 (16th century, from the library of P. Victorius), pp. 75–84. Page 84:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου καὶ θεῶ δόξα.

q = Munich 105 (15th century), fols. 34r–40v. Fol. 40v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

f = Vatican 1444 (15th century), fols. 207r–212v. Fol. 212v:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ Ῥητορίου.

These four codices are very similar to one another. In all of them, the book is entitled:  
Ῥητορίου ἔκθεσις καὶ ἐπίλυσις περὶ τε τῶν προειρημένων δώδεκα ζωδίων καὶ περὶ ἐτέρων διαφόρων ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν; likewise, the apotelesmatic introduction of Rhetorius (Paulus Alexandrinus) precedes. Furthermore, the same chapters are contained: the proemium (or rather, the chapter which, without a number, appears before the first in codex L) and chapters 1, 3, 4, 7–10, 16, 17, 21, 23–44, 46, 47. I have collated the codex q—which is not infrequently interpolated (see, for example, chapters 7 and 8) or incomplete—while a and p I have occasionally inspected.

From a certain codex of the same type as a, p, q, and f,  
m = Marcianus 335 (15th century), fols. 249v–251r (= chs. 42–47). Extracts its own selection. It contains chapters 3, 4, 7 (mutilated), 8 (likewise mutilated), 17, 21, 23–44, 46, 47. Thus the treatise of Antiochus is entitled in this codex:  
Ῥητορίου ἔκθεσις καὶ ἐπίλυσις περὶ τῶν ιβ′ ζωδίων καὶ περὶ ἐτέρων διαφόρων ἐκ τῶν Ἀντιόχου θησαυρῶν.  
Fol. 251r:  
Τέλος τῶν τοῦ ῥητορίου.

II. — n, o.

n = Marc. 336 (15th century), fol. 228r ff. Contains chapters 1–3, 7–10, 12, 15–21, 23–44, 46–47, 48–53.

Precisely the same are found in the codex  
o = Marc. 324 (15th century), fols. 127r–132r.

1 Cf. what precedes in the Berlin codex described below.  
2 In addition to these chapters, the same codex presents on fol. 112:  
περὶ σπορᾶς ἐκ τῶν ῥητορίου.  
Beg.: τοῦ ζωδιακοῦ εἰς τέ′ μοῖρας διηρημένου. Ends: δεῖ ζητεῖν τῆς συλλήψεως.  
The same is found in codex Paris 2506, which offers the same chapter on fol. 23r. On the matter, see Antiochus in Porphyrius, p. 194, 8 ff.; Hephaestion Thebanus, II, 1 (p. 24 Engelbrecht).
