...they cast horoscopes or measure the horoscope, or they measure the Moon; this is a sign of great danger and hardship. But if, under these circumstances, the benefics regard the configuration, there will be assistance for the sick person; but if it is conjoined with a malefic, there will be distress and aggravation of pains, especially if this takes place in the bounds of a malefic. But whenever it is conjoined with a benefic, there is relief and easing of pains, and especially if it happens in the bounds of a benefic. One must also observe the following:

Taking the Moonâ€™s position at the time of onset, observe from the ephemerides: after seven days, the Moon comes to its own configuration, that is, the quadrature; then, after nine days, it comes to a trine configuration relative to the inception; then, after fourteen days, it will obviously be diametrically opposed to itself; then, after nineteen days, it comes to the dexter trine; then, after twenty-one days, it will come to its dexter quadrature.

Therefore, one must observe exactly these five configurations of the Moon, and with which of the stars, after the configuration of the inception, it is going to be conjoined; for if it is conjoined with a benefic, there is relief; but if with malefics, distress and harm. Diseases beginning by day are decided after seven or nineteen days, but those at night after ten or twenty-one days. By observing these, one can predict not only the day of relief or distress, but also the hour.

For whenever the benefics meet the Moon at the critical hours, they bring relief, namely, at whatever hour they preside by degree over her; but the malefics bring distress and pain. Saturn is more harmful to those becoming ill by night, and Mars to those by day. The Moon and the horoscope, when located in tropical signs, cause relapses of diseases.

The two luminaries, when found under the earth at the time of onset, indicate a bad sign for the sick person, if also from other signs impairment appears; for one must not rashly or without examination judge from one sign alone, but from several, according to the so-called majority.

When the Moon completes the aforementioned five configurations in her course, as has been stated, if Saturn testifies to her or...
