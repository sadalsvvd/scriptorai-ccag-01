APPENDIX

They observe the horoscope, or measure the horoscope—or measure the Moon^1🤖—this is a sign of great danger and adversity. But if, when these are present, benefic planets regard the figure, there will be aid for the patient. If instead a malefic is joined, there will be distress and intensification of pains—especially if this occurs within the bounds of a malefic; but when it is joined to a benefic, there is relief, and the pains are alleviated, especially if within the bounds of a benefic. One must also observe the following:

Having taken the position of the Moon at the moment of inception, look up in the ephemerides: after seven days, the Moon arrives in its own figure, that is, the square; after nine days it comes into the triangular figure from the inception; after fourteen days, it will be in diametrical opposition to its starting point, clearly; after nineteen days, it comes into the right triangle; and after twenty-one days, it enters its own right square.

Therefore, one must carefully observe these five figures of the Moon, and with which of the stars^2🤖, after the inception's figure, it is about to be joined. For if it is joined to a benefic, there is relief; but if to malefics, distress and harm. Diseases that begin during the day are resolved in seven or nineteen days; those at night, in ten or twenty-one days. By observing these things, you will have foreknowledge not only of the day of relief or distress, but also of the very hour.

For when the benefics meet the Moon in the crisis, they bring relief, at whatever hour they regard her by degree; but the malefics bring distress and pain. Saturn is more harmful for those who fall ill at night, while Mars is more harmful for those who fall ill during the day. When the Moon and the horoscope are in the tropical signs, they induce relapses of diseases.

If both luminaries^3🤖 are found below the earth at the time of reclining^4🤖, they indicate an evil sign for the patient, especially if from other signs as well a disorder is revealed; for it is not fitting to make rash and unexamined pronouncements based on only one sign, but from several, according to the so-called majority.

When the Moon completes, by its circuit, the aforementioned five figures, as has been said, if Saturn bears witness to her or—

^1🤖 The verb διαμετρῶσιν here can be interpreted as "they measure" or "they observe diametrically," possibly in an astrological sense. Its application to both the horoscope (ὡροσκόπον) and the Moon (Σελήνην) introduces ambiguity, which is characteristic of technical vocabulary in astrology.

^2🤖 "Stars" (ἀστέρες) in ancient astrological texts generally refers to planets.

^3🤖 "Luminaries" are the Sun and the Moon in astrological terminology.

^4🤖 κατακλίσις (kataklisis) typically refers to "reclining" or the act of taking to bed due to illness; in medical-astrological contexts, this denotes the onset of a disease episode.
