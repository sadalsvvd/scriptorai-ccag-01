LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Exaltation" and "depression" are technical terms in astrology for a planet's sign of maximum and minimum strength, respectively; the subject is impersonal ("none" refers to the stars).
^2🤖 The phrase "it is improved, yet it also diminishes" likely reflects an astrological paradox or the ambivalent effect of dividing the zodiac; exact Greek may warrant further clarification.
^3🤖 "Chronikai" is a transliterated technical term used in some astrological schemata, referring to annual or time-based divisions, left in italics for clarity.
^4🤖 The 17th and 25th degrees (not 127th and 305th) are referenced; these are important traditional divisions in zodiacal aspects.
^5🤖 "Inspection" corresponds to Greek "episkopē"; "irradiation" is "aktinobolia" or "ray-casting," a specific astrological interaction.
^6🤖 "Satellitism" (Greek "doryphoria") is the English scholarly term for a planet's retinue or attendant configuration with another.
^7🤖 "Idioprosopia" (ἰδιοπροσωπία) is a rare Greek term for planetary individuality or "idiosyncrasy" in astrological context; alternative translations include "individual expression" or "proper aspect."
