*If Mars or another planet is configured [or], it unfailingly resolves the illness along the diameter. The Moon, moving in the major aspects and alone, if it signals in the square aspect, resolves the illness; but if it signals in the minor aspects, after introducing irregularity until the revolution of the other cycle, it preserves [the patient].  
*In Virgo: Moon to Saturn, if no benefic is witnessing, will cause danger about the tenth [day]; but if Saturn is witnessing the Moon, after first causing a chronic condition, it then preserves. Moon to Mars, without a benefic, destroys on the thirtieth day; but if it is witnessed by him, by divine help it saves. If, having started from minimal motion, the Moon moves towards the greater aspects towards Mars and the Sun, they will be interrupted in speech, being impeded; but if from the square aspect it passes to the greater aspects, having been in danger up to the diameter, and afterwards having become chronic in illness, they die. Moon to Saturn, either alone or also with Hermes [Mercury], or also with Aphrodite [Venus], or also with Zeus [Jupiter], moving in the greater aspects, in the same way produces chronic illnesses, but afterwards saves. The Moon, alone, at one time increasing, at another decreasing, making the revolution of the cycle or *** the condition. Moon to Zeus or Aphrodite or Hermes or at the seventh or even at the ninth or ω <?> after the revolution of the cycle from the very sign of Virgo until the quintile, resolves the illness.

In Libra: Moon to Saturn, especially subtracting by the numbers or also by the light, and especially if also at night, indicates extreme danger; but if also Mars occupies the same figure, unfailingly it destroys at the quintile. Moon to Mars, with no benefic witnessing, destroys within the tenth day; but if a benefic is witnessing, it saves until the diameter. Moon to Saturn together with Aphrodite and Hermes, or also together with either of these, moving in the minor aspects up to the square, it brings about all manner of care, and surrounding with chronic conditions, thus saves. Moon to Saturn alone will certainly release, moving in the minor aspects; but if it hastens in the major aspects, up to the diameter, it saves. Moon to Mars and the Sun, but indeed with those, or also to Hermes: it produces chronic illnesses and a delay of recovery, and with danger; but if a benefic is witnessing, it saves for payment or reward, except only in the case of the same affliction, that is, of the eyes. If Hermes is conjoined with the Moon alone, whether waxing or waning, it produces malignant diseases, but resolves them at the diameter. In general, the tropical and equinoctial signs have malignant diseases.
