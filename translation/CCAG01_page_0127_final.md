*If Mars, or even another planet, should be configured thus,^1🤖 he invariably dissolves the disease upon the diameter. The Moon, moving over the major aspects and being solitary, when she marks the square, dissolves the disease; but if she marks the lesser aspects, she brings about irregularity until the revolution of the other cycle, yet preserves the native.

*In Virgo: The Moon towards Saturn (when the benefic does not observe her) brings about danger around the tenth day; but if the Moon is observed by the benefic, she, causing a long-lasting affliction, subsequently saves. The Moon towards Mars, without a benefic involved, removes the native on the thirtieth day; but if she is observed by him, she rescues through divine assistance. If, however, having proceeded from the least motion, she moves toward the greater motions toward Mars and the Sun, they will be checked by impediments in their pronouncements; but if from the square she turns to the greater motions, those who have been endangered even more up to the diameter, then lingering in the illness, die. The Moon towards Saturn, whether alone or also with Hermes (Mercury) or with Aphrodite (Venus) or with Zeus (Jupiter), when moving over the major aspects, likewise produces protracted illnesses but later saves. The Moon, still solitary, now increasing, now decreasing, traversing the circuit or *** the affliction. The Moon to Zeus or Aphrodite or Hermes or the seventh, or even the ninth, or ô <?>, after the lunar circuit from the sign of Virgo up to the trine, dissolves the disease.^2🤖

In Libra: The Moon towards Saturn, especially subtracting by the numbers or by the light—and especially if even at night—denotes extreme danger; but if Mars also assumes the same configuration, he invariably removes the native upon the trine. The Moon towards Mars, when no benefic observes, removes within ten days; but if observed by a benefic, preserves up to the diameter. The Moon towards Saturn with Aphrodite and Hermes, or with either of these, moving through the lesser aspects up to the square, always brings about solicitude, and thus saves, having enveloped the native in chronic afflictions. The Moon towards Saturn alone will always release the native, when moving through the lesser aspects; but if she hastens over the major aspects, till the diameter, she saves. The Moon to Mars and the Sun, and indeed with them or also to Hermes, brings about chronic diseases and persistence of the condition, along with danger; but when a benefic observes, she saves for a fee or reward, except only in the case of the same affliction, that is, of the eyes. When Hermes is combined with the solitary Moon, whether waxing or waning, malignant diseases arise, but he dissolves them at the diameter. In general, the tropical and equinoctial signs produce malignant diseases.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Should be configured thus" translates "σχηματισθείη" as a technical astrological expression: the planet forming the designated aspect or configuration. The agency resides in the planet; hence "he" (for Mars) as subject.

^2🤖 The clauses "the seventh, or even the ninth, or ô <?>, after the lunar circuit from the sign of Virgo up to the trine" are ambiguous. The Greek likely references astrological houses or aspects—possibly the seventh and ninth houses or significant aspects (trine/hexagonal), but the precise meaning is disputed. For transparency, a literal rendering is given; see the critical apparatus for alternatives.
