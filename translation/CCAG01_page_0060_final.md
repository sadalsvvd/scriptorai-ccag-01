LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "Hermes' [wind] for children" literally translates as "the one of Hermes for the children." The context likely refers to winds or airs associated with Hermes, possibly indicating direction or influence; "for the children" could refer to a group or type, but the precise sense is obscure and might require further astrological contextualization.

^2🤖 "Kronos" is the Greek name for the planet Saturn; "of Hermes in the city" may refer to Mercury/Hermes' influence or placement within a city context, but could denote an astrological formula.

^3🤖 The term for "runaways" is ambiguous; the phrase "the ascendant is the one running away — of the feet or the chest" may refer to astrological markers of escape, possibly relating to body parts associated with signs.

^4🤖 The word rendered "incendiary" is rare and could mean "one who sets fires" or "fire-starter" in a more general sense; the technical term for arsonist might also be intended.

^5🤖 "Halizonic" (ἁλιζωνίτικυτέρους) is obscure; it might relate to quick, wandering, or changeable signs, perhaps rooted in a term for "sea-related" or "restless." The exact astrological meaning is uncertain.

^6🤖 "Exhalations" (ἀπορροιαί) is a literal translation and may refer to celestial or atmospheric influences in astrology.

^7🤖 "Consider the Sun and the squares — or of rivers." The mention of "rivers" is enigmatic and could denote a technical astrological or geomantic factor.
