The text proceeds with these words (f. 140v):

If someone is born when the bright star at the tail of Leo is rising—which is at the 27th degree of the same Leo—or at the one at his loins, which is also at the 27th degree of the same sign, or again when the bright star of Hydra is rising, which rises with the third degree of Leo, having the nature of Saturn and Venus, these rising at the hour of birth make those thus born both fortunate and wealthy and most illustrious, but also passionate and inclined to shameful acts or effeminate in beauty, and furthermore fond of dancing and prone to wicked speech regarding matters of Venus; as they advance in age, some become temple-robbers, finding themselves involved for the sake of a certain religiousness—divine in a sense—or honored for their continence, and refraining from certain prisoners and from books, indeed even becoming experts in the esoteric; they also become lovers of things heavenly, having eyes rather greyish than bright, and handsome in appearance.

Next, the author discusses the bright star of the Hyades (the brightest of the Hyades), which produces wealthy and prominent men (f. 141r):

“For just as the star itself and the position of the Hyades are in the whole world and to all people well-known—and is more conspicuous than the others—so too are those born at the rising or culmination of the brightest of the Hyades most renowned and most illustrious and richer than other people. And it effects the same when it shares the same degree with the Moon at its rising or culmination. For this is the only star that has double the power of the other stars, for when it is rising, the bright star of Antares is setting at equal distance, set diametrically opposite at the 15th degree of Scorpio, and both are in the zodiacal circle. Thus indeed, both in the western regions of the inhabited world and in the eastern and in other climates, those under its influence are acclaimed and greatly capable.”
