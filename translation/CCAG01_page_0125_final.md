...of those, after danger, she saves. The Moon to Mars, especially during the daytime,  
when Saturn holds the same configuration and the benefic [planet] is inactive, will not permit surpassing the ninth day; but if the benefic is active, she removes [the illness] on the twenty-fifth day.  
The Moon to Saturn, and especially even to Mercury (Hermes), dissolving the conjunction after the square aspect, turns the situation for the worse if no benefic oversees^1🤖; she will not permit surpassing the crisis at the diametrically opposite (critical) point.  
The Moon to Mars or the Sun, additive to the numbers^2🤖—especially at full moon or before the gibbous phase—produces an acute crisis up to the seventh day (or fifth day [penthemeros])^3🤖. If the Sun is in Leo, the condition of Aphrodite (Venus) will be cardiac (of the heart). Watch for Jupiter being in attendance at any hour; observe whether he acts as a benefic in the ascendant. And if, perchance, during the crisis, the patient rinses the mouth, bathes, or drinks wine^4🤖, there will be great relief; but if from the seventh day the patient takes a turn for the worse, the situation will be despairing. However, if the benefic contemplates the crisis after the seventh day, health may be anticipated.

In Gemini: If the Moon is to Saturn, especially additive to the numbers and light, and Mars holds the same configuration, with no benefic involved, she removes [the illness] after the thirtieth day; but if a benefic is involved, she saves by directing [the course] to chronic afflictions. The Moon to Mars, especially additive to the numbers and light, with Saturn in the same configuration, with no benefic present, she saves one who has been endangered. The Moon to Saturn and Mercury, especially after conjunction, subtractive in numbers, if not rendered benefic, removes [the patient]; but if all the benefics are overseeing, those who have fallen ill from various causes are saved. If the Moon is not configured with any planet at the crisis, she will produce the illnesses in a more irregular fashion; but in opposition she resolves them. The Moon to Mars, or especially a waxing full moon—or when she first becomes gibbous—and even more so when she moves in numbers to the more significant degrees, up to the square aspect, and especially if she inclines towards despair; but if from the square the disease turns for the worse and descends into the belly, patients are certainly lost. But if a benefic oversees the crisis, particularly if Saturn is not engaged, there is hope of salvation—either from the square or, in any case, subsequently.

In Cancer: The Moon to Saturn, she prolongs the illness up to the...

LLM Translation Footnotes

1. ^1🤖 "Oversees" (from κατοπτεύοντος/θεωροῦντος) here means to observe, watch over, or attend—a technical term in ancient astrology for planetary influence or aspect, often with a benefic (Jupiter or Venus) potentially mitigating harm.  
2. ^2🤖 “Additive to the numbers” refers to the progression towards critical days or aspects in the ancient astrological-medical system, with “numbers” indicating the counting of days in a disease or crisis, or degrees between planetary positions.  
3. ^3🤖 The Greek sometimes specifies the “penthemeros” (five-day crisis), but manuscripts may differ; the progression toward the seventh day is also common in ancient crisis theory.  
4. ^4🤖 The original Greek verb here is obscure; possibilities include “mirroring,” “bathing,” or “pouring wine,” functions that could symbolically relate to relief or intervention at the moment of crisis. (Kroll and other commentators have discussed this as a corrupt hexameter line in the tradition.) Alternate interpretations are possible.
