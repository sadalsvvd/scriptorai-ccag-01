...it saves those who, after danger, survive. The Moon to Mars, especially by day, when Saturn has the same configuration and if a benefic is not operative, does not permit [the patient] to pass beyond the ninth day; if, however, a benefic is operative, on the twenty-fifth day it removes the illness.  
The Moon to Saturn, or even to Hermes (Mercury), dissolving the configuration after the square aspect or conjunction, turns for the worse if a benefic does not observe; it will not allow the crisis at the opposition to be passed.  
The Moon to Mars or to the Sun, additive in the numbers, especially at full moon or just before the gibbous phase, induces acute conditions up to an interval of five days. But if the Sun is in Leo, the disposition related to Aphrodite (Venus) will be cardiac. With Jupiter attending, it is necessary to observe at every hour, and if a benefic is found to be ascending at the critical indication—whether in cases of cupping, bathing, or the administration of wine—there will be significant help. But if from the seventh [hour or day] it turns for the worse, the patient is given up as lost. If, however, a benefic oversees the crisis from the seventh [hour or day], health is to be expected.

In Gemini: The Moon to Saturn, especially in the numbers and removed from light, when Mars has the same configuration and no benefic intervenes, removes the illness after the thirtieth day; but if a benefic intervenes, inducing chronic ailments, it saves. The Moon to Mars, especially in the numbers and with increasing light, when Saturn has the same configuration and no benefic intervenes, yet saves the one who has been in danger. The Moon to Saturn and Hermes (Mercury), especially from conjunction and subtractive in the numbers, if it is not rendered benefic, removes the illness; but if all benefics are observing, those who have fallen ill in various ways are saved. If no star aspects the Moon at the crisis, the diseases it causes will be rather inconstant; yet at the opposition it resolves them. The Moon to Mars, or especially to a waxing full Moon or with the first gibbous phase, particularly when proceeding to the major numbers, up to the square, mostly inclines toward despair; but if from the square the disease turns for the worse and descends into the abdomen, all are destroyed. But if a benefic oversees the crisis, especially if Saturn is not involved, there is hope of recovery either from the square or at any rate later.

In Cancer: The Moon to Saturn, prolongs the illness up to the
