APPENDIX

…the Moon, Jupiter, and the Lot of Fortune, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter, as Dorotheus says. But I found Mars and Saturn encompassing Hermes, the Ascendant, the Moon, and Jupiter, as Antigonus teaches; yet in fact, Mars was also diametrically opposed to the Midheaven. Therefore, at every inception, it is necessary to examine both the culminations of the Sun and the stars, and the enclosure* of the Ascendant, the Moon, and the star ruling the inception. For not only were the Ascendant and the Moon encompassed by Saturn and Mars, but also Venus, or the one with greater influence over the inception; for Mars was in opposition to Cancer, and Saturn made a square to Virgo. Thus, nearly all the stars were found encompassed by the two malefics; Antigonus mentions this configuration in the nativity in the third book. And if you also consider the specific form, observe Hermes being harmed by Saturn and placed in the twelfth house.   [F. C.]

F. 126r (263). 78. Inception of Leontius crowned at Antioch¹.

He, having received the inception from two astrologers, was crowned and immediately fell from power and fortune. In the year of Diocletian, in the month of Epiphi, 20th, at the beginning of the first hour: Sun in Cancer 2°, Moon in Cancer 7°, Saturn in Scorpio 15°, Jupiter in Cancer 5°, Mars in Cancer 20°, Venus in Gemini 27°, Hermes in Leo 19°, Ascendant in Cancer 23°, Midheaven in Aries, lower Midheaven in Capricorn 14°, conjunction in Cancer, Lot of Fortune in Scorpio 17°, Daimon in Aries, exaltation of the nativity in Aries.

Many considered the inception favorable, on account of the rising of the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars at the Ascendant, the return of Hermes, and the benefic fortune (ἀγαθοτυκ) of the Moon with respect to Saturn and Jupiter; but they did not give precedence to Hermes, who was ruling and presiding, but had fallen into affliction—for he was at the greatest distance from the Sun, something that was said to result in a living death (biothanatos), and he was only beheld by Saturn. Nor was Venus alone able to remedy the affliction, for the Sun intervened with her. Nor again…

¹ Leontius, who aspired to the throne in the time of emperor Zeno and who, it seems, was not crowned at Antioch but at Tarsus in the year 483, is known to have been encouraged to rebel by the prophecies of the senator Pamprepius, whom Christian historians (Theophanes, p. 129, 10, 130, 3, ed. de Boor; Damascius, Vita Isidori, §110, ed. Westermann; Suidas s.v. Παμπρέπιος) accuse of sorcery and prodigy-mongering. Cf. Rev. instr. publ., l.c., p. 10ff.
