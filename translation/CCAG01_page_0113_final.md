APPENDIX

…the Moon, Jupiter, and the Lot of Fortune, because it was culminated by Jupiter, as Dorotheus says. But I found Mars and Saturn enclosing Mercury, the Ascendant, the Moon, and Jupiter, as Antigonus teaches; moreover, Mars was also diametrically opposing the Midheaven, as a malefic. It is therefore necessary, in every inception^1🤖, to examine also the culminations of the Sun and of the stars, as well as the enclosures of the Ascendant, the Moon, and whatever star has authority over the rulership of the inception. For not only were the Ascendant and the Moon enclosed by Saturn and Mars, but also Venus—or rather, the one of greater significance for the inception; for Mars, in fact, opposed Cancer and Saturn squared Virgo; thus, it was found that almost all the stars were enclosed by the two malefics. This configuration is mentioned by Antigonus in the nativity described in the third book. And if you also seek the manner, observe Mercury being afflicted by Saturn and in the twelfth house^2🤖. [F. C.]

F. 126r (263). 88. Inception at the coronation of Leontius in Antioch.^1

This man, having received his inception from two astrologers, was crowned and immediately fell from kingly power and fortune. In the era of Diocletian, in the month of Epiphi, 20th day, at the beginning of the first hour: Sun in Cancer 2°, Moon in Cancer 7°, Saturn in Scorpio 15°, Jupiter in Cancer 5°, Mars in Cancer 20°, Venus in Gemini 27°, Mercury in Leo 19°, Ascendant in Cancer 23°, Midheaven in Aries, lower Midheaven in Capricorn 14°, conjunction in Cancer, Lot of Fortune in Scorpio 17°, Daemon in Aries, exaltation of the nativity in Aries.

Many deemed the inception to be promising, either because of the angular positions^3🤖 of the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars, the return of Mercury, or the favorable configuration of the Moon with Saturn and Jupiter; but they did not give priority to Mercury, the planet governing and overseeing affairs, for he had fallen into affliction: for he was at his greatest distance^4🤖 from the Sun, which also brings about the possibility of sudden death, and he was seen only by Saturn. For Venus alone was not able to heal the affliction, since the Sun intervened with her; nor again—

¹ Leontius, who, under the emperor Zeno, aspired to the throne, and in the year 483 (as it appears) was crowned not at Antioch but at Tarsus; it is known that he was incited to stir up sedition by the prophecies of Pamprepius the senator, whom Christian historians accuse of magic and prodigy-mongering (Theophanes, p. 129, 10; 130, 3, ed. de Boor; Damascius, Life of Isidore, §110, ed. Westermann; Suidas s.v. Pamprepius). Cf. Rev. instr. publ., l. c., p. 10 s.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “In every inception”: The Greek “ἐπὶ πάσῃ καταρχῇ” could also be translated as “in every election” or “beginning,” but in astrological context, “inception” or “election” both refer to the choice of a moment to commence an activity.
^2🤖 “Twelfth house”: Greek “ιβ’” refers to the twelfth house from the Ascendant, a place of particular weakness in ancient astrology.
^3🤖 “Angular positions”: The Greek term sometimes translated as “horoscopy” can specifically refer to being upon an angle (Ascendant, Midheaven, etc.), i.e., in a position of power in the chart.
^4🤖 “Greatest distance”: The phrase refers to Mercury’s maximal elongation from the Sun, considered astrologically critical and, if afflicted, a sign of vulnerability.
