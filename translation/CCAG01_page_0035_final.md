LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Variation” (Greek παραλλαγή) is a technical term in ancient astrology/astronomy, sometimes rendered as “parallax”. Here, “variation” is retained as an accepted term for an exact diameter of 4 degrees.

^2🤖 “Void-of-course” (Greek κενοδρομία) refers to the Moon when it makes no aspects before leaving its current sign, a concept retained in modern astrology.

^3🤖 “Tritonocracy” (Greek τριτωνοκρατορία) is a rare, technical astrological term. The Greek is left in transliteration due to uncertainty; alternate renderings might include “governance of the third part” or “rule of the tritone”, but these are speculative.

^4🤖 The Greek σπορίμου ζῳδίου translates literally as “seed-producing sign”. “Prolific sign” is the usual rendering in astrological usage.

^5🤖 “Transfers” here likely refers to astrological directions or transmissions (Greek ἀναφοραί). “Handy canons” denotes practical, ready-to-use tables or rules; the exact Greek is sometimes uncertain due to manuscript variants.
