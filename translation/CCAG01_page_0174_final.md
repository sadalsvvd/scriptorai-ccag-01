...the Sun is at the 12th degree of Gemini, the Moon at the 28th degree of Aquarius, and the Ascendant at the 10th degree of Libra, for a diurnal nativity. Here, I measure the distance from the Sun to the Moon, since the nativity is diurnal. Therefore, I take (fol. 130v) from Gemini, the 12th degree, where the Sun is, and from Aquarius, the 28th degree, where the Moon is; the sum is 16 degrees. Then I count the intervening signs, at 30 degrees each; there are seven between Gemini and Aquarius—seven times 30 is 210. I then add the degrees of the signs in which the Sun and Moon are placed; the total is 238. I add also the 10 degrees of the Ascendant, making a sum of 248. Next, I begin from the Ascendant itself, giving the Ascendant first 30 degrees. I assign 30 degrees each to Libra and the following signs up to Taurus—since eight times 30 is 240; there remain 8, which I give to Gemini. Thus, I say the Lot of Fortune is at the 8th degree of Gemini. Then, I examine how Gemini is situated: whether it occupies the place of the angle, or of the entire revolution, or whether any of the benefic stars is there, and all other factors handed down in the tabular examination; thus I pronounce concerning things pertaining to the body, or what is destined to come to the body. And these things pertain to diurnal nativities, etc.

F. 132r. Reasonably, then, the first seven lots, the universal ones—I mean those corresponding to the seven stars—were designated with such names by the most divine Hermes, who called the lot of the Moon “Fortune” (Tychē), that of the Sun “Daimon” (Spirit), and the remainder accordingly. For by nature, in fact, the Moon is established as Fortune, the Sun as Daimon (Spirit), Venus as Eros (Love), that of Hermes as Anankē (Necessity), that of Ares as Tolma (Boldness), that of Zeus as Nīkē (Victory), that of Kronos as Nemesis (Retribution); and the Ascendant is, as it were, an impartial arbiter, established at the center of the entire cosmos, since whatever comes into being first draws its life from it, and likewise every activity has its origin from it. Fortune (Tychē) signifies all matters concerning the body and actions in life; it is established as an indicator of possessions, reputation, and authority. But Daimon (Spirit) is lord of the soul, character, intelligence, and all powers; it sometimes also collaborates with reasoning about actions. Eros (Love) signifies desires and appetites as arise by choice; it is established as the initiator of friendship and gratitude. Anankē (Necessity) brings constraints, subjugations, struggles, and wars, enmities and hatred, judgments and all other violent things that befall humans. Tolma (Boldness) incites daring...
