For example: the Sun is at 12° Gemini, the Moon at 28° Aquarius, and the Ascendant at 10° Libra, in the case of a diurnal birth. Here, I measure the distance from the Sun to the Moon, since the birth is diurnal^1🤖. So I take 12° Gemini, which is the Sun’s position, and 28° Aquarius, which is the Moon’s position. The total is 97°. Next, I count the intervening signs at 30° each; there are seven between Gemini and Aquarius—seven times 30 is 210°. I then add the degrees in which the Sun and the Moon are located: 12° (Gemini) and 28° (Aquarius), producing 40°; adding this to 210° gives 250°. I also add the degrees of the Ascendant, 10°, for a total of 260°. 

Then, I begin from the Ascendant itself, granting the first 30° to Libra. Thus, I assign 30° each to Libra and the ensuing signs up to and including Taurus; that is, eight times 30°, which is 240°. There remain 20°, which I assign to Gemini. Therefore, I say that the Lot of Fortune^2🤖 is in Gemini at 20°. Next, I consider how Gemini is situated—whether it occupies an angular place, or the entire arc of the Ascendant, or whether any of the benefic stars are there, and all the other considerations which are handed down in the chart-based examination^3🤖. And so I make my pronouncement concerning matters that are about to happen or pertain to the body. And these things, then, in the case of a diurnal birth, etc.

F. 132r. Appropriately, the first seven lots—the universal ones, namely those of the seven stars (planets)—the most divine Hermes gave such names: he called the Lot of the Moon “Fortune,” that of the Sun “Daimon”^4🤖, and so on. For by nature, the Moon is established as Fortune, the Sun as Daimon, Venus as Eros (Love), Mercury’s as Necessity, Mars’s as Boldness (Tolma), Jupiter’s as Victory, and Saturn’s as Nemesis^5🤖. The Ascendant, being intermediary to these, is set as the judge (arbiter), the foundation of the entire cosmos, since that which comes into being draws its life first from it, and likewise every action takes its beginning from it.

Now, Fortune signifies all matters concerning the body and actions in life, and has come to indicate possessions, reputation, and authority. Daimon rules the soul, character, intelligence, and every form of power (sovereignty); at times, too, it contributes guidance in matters of action. Eros denotes appetites and desires arising from deliberate choice and is set as the cause of friendship and favor. Necessity brings about constraints and subjugations, strife and wars, enmities, hatred, condemnations, and all other violent events that befall humans. Boldness...

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The term "diurnal" is used here following astrological terminology; it refers specifically to a birth during the daytime, which affects the computation and direction when measuring between the Sun and Moon.

^2🤖 "Lot of Fortune" translates "κλῆρος τῆς Τύχης" (klēros tēs Tychēs) and is the standard designation in historical and modern astrological literature. The Greek "κλῆρος" (klēros) is technically "Lot," a calculated point or "Arabic Part."

^3🤖 The phrase "examination by table" or "chart-based examination" translates the Greek "πινακική ἐπισκέψις," which refers to a systematic, likely tabular or chart-based astrological analysis. This could also be rendered "tabular analysis" or "the examination set forth in the tables."

^4🤖 "Daimon" (δαιμων) is left untranslated here, as it refers to a specific astrological concept denoting a personal fate or spiritual faculty, not simply "spirit" or "genius."

^5🤖 Modern planetary names (Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) are used for clarity, but the Greek names are: Aphrodite (Venus), Hermes (Mercury), Ares (Mars), Zeus (Jupiter), Kronos (Saturn). Parentheses indicate the Lot’s attributed quality or epithet.
