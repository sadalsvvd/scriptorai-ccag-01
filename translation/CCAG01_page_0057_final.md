LLM Translation Footnotes

1. 🤖 “Under the rays” is a technical term in Hellenistic astrology (from Greek “ὕπαυγον”), denoting when a planet is so close to the Sun as to be rendered invisible, usually considered detrimental. The phrase "in its own house or exaltation" refers to positions of astrological dignity. The text corrects the opinion that such dignities protect from harm in this state.
2. 🤖 "Depression" is a standard term for "fall" or "detriment," a technical condition of planetary weakness.
3. 🤖 "Declinations" refers to a technical astrological/astronomical parameter; alternate translation might be "declines" if reflecting an archaic or specific context.
4. 🤖 If the original implies "fifteen-degree divisions," an alternative could be "each of the fifteen-degree divisions of Aries."
5. 🤖 "Taking away [virtue]" references the reduction or loss of planetary influence; "virtue" is a common translation of "dynamis" or the astrological power of a body.
6. 🤖 "deest textus" (Latin): the text is missing at this point. I include both English explanation and the Latin for scholarly accuracy.
7. 🤖 "Been united" is a euphemism for sexual union; a more explicit translation might be "have had intercourse."
8. 🤖 "Force" is used here in the sense of an impersonal astrological influence or effect; "power" is an alternate but less common rendering.
