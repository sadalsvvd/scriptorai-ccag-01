CODICES FLORENTINI

γ′ is missing in the margin; in the index written on folio 10, there is a heading γ′ κανόνια, in the text [the heading is] περὶ τῆς οἰκουμένης (“One should know that some—among whom are Panaetius the Stoic and Eudorus the Academic—are called antichthones”). The opposing signs are as follows—the Pisces. | We have canons 21–22.

Folio 23. ιδ′. On the method for determining the longitudinal epoch of the luminaries [so in the index; in the text after] epoch: of the Sun and the Moon, even if not exactly from the conjunctions and full moons. (From these, therefore, it is possible to find—and the inquiry in the canons.)
Folio 23v. ιε′. On knowing, at conjunctions and full moons, whether there is an eclipse. (It is necessary to know—sid ʿ maʾ lth.)
Folio 24v. ις′. On the ecliptic conjunctions and the latitude of the Moon, and in what number there will be an eclipse. (And about the conjunctions, it is necessary to know—in order to determine the eclipse or the parallax.)
Folio 25. ιε′. On the conjunctions in eclipses. (It is necessary concerning the conjunctions—sixty-first.)
     ιζ′. Canons.
Folio 25v. ιη′. On the epochs of the Moon. (So that also from which—the composition of Ptolemy.)
Folio 26. ιθ′. Other chapters concerning the stars [title taken from the index]. (According to the divisions of Claudius Ptolemy—the difference in the canons.)
Folio 28 without title. And for the five wandering stars, if observed by astrolabe—or by calculations.
(Folio 28v. At the bottom margin, a more recent and less elegant hand has written: “But we add to the least hourly motion of the Moon always the same amount, sometimes more, sometimes less, and sometimes nothing; and for this reason nothing absurd occurs, nor is it less than the minimum.”)
Folio 29v without title. According to the Greek manual—the transit of the Moon.
Folio 30. κ′. In the index: five canons; in the text: simple years of the Moon.
     κα′. On the exposition of oracles. (You must first know—at the hour of inquiry.)
Folio 31v. κβ′. Other chapters concerning the 70 eclipses. (On the solar eclipses, if indeed—the fifth and the remaining parts.)
Folio 32. κγ′. On the ephemerides. (Greater and lesser places—concerning the recording and the commencements.)
Folio 32v. κδ′. On the calculation of the Sun. (We make the calculation of the Sun—for the stations and the phases.)
Folio 33. κε′. The eclipses. (Year zōpd′ [= 1376 AD] July 17th, eclipse of the Sun—after December 5th of ϥe′) a later hand added: <T>ps ϥpspz year [= 1387 AD] eclipses of the Sun—and April 29th, hour 4, lunar eclipse.
