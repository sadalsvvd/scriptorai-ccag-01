CODICES FLORENTINI

γ΄ is missing in the margin; in the table of contents (folio 10), chapter γ΄ contains canons (κανόνια); in the text: on the inhabited world (note that some, among whom are Panaitios the Stoic and Eudoros the Academic, are called antichthones^1🤖) [sqr.^2🤖]. The opposed zodiacal signs are as follows—Pisces. 

Folio 23. Chapter 14 [ιδ΄]. On determining the longitudinal epoch of the luminaries (so in the table of contents; in the text, following "epoch": of the Sun and Moon, even if not exactly from the conjunctions and full moons) (From these, indeed, it is possible to find—and the investigation is carried out in the canons).

Folio 23v. Chapter 15 [ιε΄]. On knowing, in synodic full moons, whether there is an eclipse (It is necessary to know—pages σιδ᾿ μαʽ λθ΄ [314–439]^3🤖).

Folio 24v. Chapter 16 [ις΄]. On the eclipse conjunctions and the latitude of the Moon, and in what number an eclipse will occur (And concerning the conjunctions, one must know—whether it is an eclipse or parallax).

Folio 25. Chapter 15 [ιε΄]. On the conjunctions in eclipses (It is necessary, concerning the conjunctions—sixty-first).

 Chapter 17 [ιζ΄]. Canons.

Folio 25v. Chapter 18 [ιη΄]. On the epochs of the Moon (So that also from whichever—of the compilation of Ptolemy).

Folio 26. Chapter 19 [ιθ΄]. Other chapters on the stars (heading from the table of contents) (According to the divisions of Claudius Ptolemy—the differences in the canons).

Folio 28, without title. In the case of the five wandering stars, whether it is determined by means of an astrolabe or by calculations.

(Folio 28v. In the lower margin, a later hand (less elegant) added: And we always add the least hourly motion of the Moon, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes nothing; and for this reason, nothing absurd results, nor is it less than the least.)

Folio 29v, without title. According to the Greek manual—the Moon’s motion.

Folio 30. Chapter 20 [κ΄]. In the table of contents: five canons; in the text: the simple years of the Moon.

 Chapter 21 [κα΄]. On the exposition of oracles (You must first know—at the hour of the inquiry).

Folio 31v. Chapter 22 [κβ΄]. Other chapters on the eclipses (On solar eclipses, if indeed—the fifth and the remaining parts).

Folio 32. Chapter 23 [κγ΄]. On the ephemerides (Greater northern and southern latitudes^4🤖—concerning the recording and the commencements).

Folio 32v. Chapter 24 [κδ΄]. On the calculation (“vote”) of the Sun^5🤖 (The calculation of the Sun we perform—the “stations” and the phases).

Folio 33. Chapter 25 [κε΄]. The eclipses (In the year ζωπδ΄ [= 1376 CE]^6🤖, July 17: eclipse of the Sun—after the 5th of December of the year ϥεʽ [= 475]; a later hand added: <T>ψ ϥψϥζ year [= 1387 CE]: eclipses of the Sun—and on the 29th of April at the 4th hour, eclipse of the Moon).

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Antichthones” refers to people living on the opposite side of the world; in ancient geographic theory, this is the concept of the antipodes.

^2🤖 “sqr.” is an abbreviation for the Latin “sequitur,” meaning “the following”; it marks a continuation or following content in manuscripts.

^3🤖 "σιδ᾿ μαʽ λθ΄" are Greek numerals corresponding to 314, 41, and 39; here likely referencing pages or folio numbers.

^4🤖 The literal Greek is “upper and lower places greater,” but the context is geographic latitude (north and south).

^5🤖 “Calculation (‘vote’) of the Sun” translates τῆς ψήφου τοῦ Ἡλίου, a technical astrological term; here, “vote” refers to a value or point assigned in computation, not literal voting.

^6🤖 Greek years ζωπδ΄ and ϥψϥζ have been converted to Common Era (CE) dates for clarity, following manuscript calendrical systems.
