LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 On the translation of "he will prevail over the one whom (i.e., whom he is to prevail over?) he indicates": There is ambiguity in the Greek; the construction may mean either "he will prevail, as [the chart] indicates," or "he will prevail over the one whom he indicates." This parenthetical signals interpretive uncertainty.

^2🤖 "Those with advanced feminine indicators": The Greek here may refer to progressed or angular feminine signs or significators in astrological charts; the sense is technical and refers to markers interpreted by the astrologer. Alternate translation: "take those with advanced feminine qualities."

^3🤖 "Figure is above what is apparent": “φανεροῦ” rendered as "apparent" follows standard astrological English. The phrase is elliptical; it may refer to a planetary aspect elevated above the visible horizon or what is manifest.

^4🤖 "Of the setting and of the culmination": "Culmination" here is the technical term for the midheaven (MC) in astrology.

^5🤖 "A brother is produced": The Greek is impersonal; this may mean "the result is a brother" or "one becomes a brother." Subject is ambiguous in the manuscript.

^6🤖 "Afflictions of the feet (podagra) become unstable": "Podagra" refers to gout or afflictions of the feet more generally; translation clarified for modern readers.

^7🤖 "[in the index, in the chapter headings Dʹ <== two> of which in a. t. a.]": This is a rendering of an elliptical editorial or manuscript note, likely referencing a system of chapter enumeration; precise meaning is uncertain and preserved for transparency.
