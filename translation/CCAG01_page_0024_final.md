^1🤖 “κακοποιῶν δεῖ ἅλωσις τῆς πόλεως” is rendered as “if the malefics are present, the city will be taken.” In astrological context, “malefics” (κακοποιοί) refers to harmful planets, usually Mars and Saturn. The impersonal clause “δεῖ ἅλωσις τῆς πόλεως” means “the taking of the city is necessary” or “the city will be taken.” This interprets the astrological configuration as prognosticating the city's capture. Alternate readings could be “the city should be taken,” but the prevailing meaning is predictive rather than prescriptive.
