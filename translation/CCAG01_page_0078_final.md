LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The word rendered here as “heliacal rising” is the Greek “δοροφορία,” a technical term in ancient astronomy for the first visible rising of a star or planet before sunrise. Alternate translations like “processions” are less precise in this context.
^2🤖 The Greek “κορτίνα” (kortina) is ambiguous; it could refer to a curtain, screen, or siege engine such as a mantlet or palisade. “Palisade” is used here for clarity, but the term may encompass various siege apparatus depending on context. Alternate translations include “curtain,” “screen,” or “mantlet.”
