[1 Heliodorus, whose “Synousiai” were pillaged by Palchus around the year 480 CE, seems to be the same as Heliodorus “the interpreter of destinies through nativities” and the “mathematician” who at Antioch in the year 374 (Tillemont, vol. V, 1701, p. 107 ff.) denounced by name the notary Theodorus, who was aspiring to imperial power (Ammianus Marcellinus XXIX, 1, 3), and thus had considerable influence with Valens (ibid., 2, 6 ff.). He must be distinguished from the Heliodorus who wrote the commentary on the Introduction (Εἰσαγωγή, Eisagoge) of Paulus Alexandrinus (see above, p. 26, n. 1), since it is certain that the book of Paulus was published after the year 378 (Fabricius–Harles, Bibliotheca graeca, vol. IV, p. 140 ff.), while, according to Ammianus (XXIX, 2; 13), that Heliodorus of Antioch died before the death of Valens, i.e., before the year 378. It is possible that the commentator on Paulus is not different from the Heliodorus who dedicated a poem on the sacred art to Emperor Theodosius (408–450 CE) (ed. Fabricius–Harles, vol. VIII, p. 118 ff.; see about Heliodoruses, p. 126 f.), a man not unknown in the Middle Ages (cf. Leo the Grammarian in Cramer’s Anecdota graeca, Paris, II, p. 306–10: “Heliodorus writes in iambic verse the making of gold for the same Theodosius,” and Theodosius of Melitene, ed. Tafel, p. 73, col. 4, who mistakenly confound him with the author of the Aethiopica). Certainly, the Byzantines of the 11th century, to which period manuscripts Marcianus 299 and Laurentianus 28, 34 (cod. 12, fol. 164) belong, do not distinguish Heliodorus the chemist from Heliodorus the interpreter of Paulus, but equally call both “Heliodorus the philosopher.” The arcane sciences of alchemy and astrology were always regarded as previously associated, as both the codices (see e.g. Paris. 2419) and general knowledge show (cf. Usener, De Stephano Alexandrino, 1879, p. 9). — F. C.]
