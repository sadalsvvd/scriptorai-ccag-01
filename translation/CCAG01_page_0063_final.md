[1 Heliodorus, whose Synousiai Palchus, ca. A.D. 480, excerpted, appears to be the same as Heliodorus, "interpreter of fates through genitures," and "mathematician," who, at Antioch in 374 (Tillemont, vol. V, 1701, p. 107 sq.) reported the notary Theodorus, who aspired to become emperor (Ammianus XXIX, 1,3), and thus gained great influence with Valens (ibid., 2, 6 sqq.). He must be different from the Heliodorus who wrote a commentary on the Introduction of Paulus Alexandrinus (see above, p. 26, n. 1), since it is certain that Paulus’s book appeared after A.D. 378 (Fabricius–Harles, Bibl. gr., vol. IV, p. 140 sq.), whereas that Heliodorus of Antioch, according to Ammianus (XXIX, 2; 13), died before the death of Valens, i.e., before A.D. 378. It is possible that the commentator on Paulus is not different from the Heliodorus who dedicated a poem on the sacred art to Emperor Theodosius (A.D. 408–450) (ed. Fabricius–Harles, vol. VIII, p. 118 ff.; cf. de Heliodoris, p. 126 f.), a man not unknown in the Middle Ages (cf. Leo the Grammarian in Cramer, Anecdota Graeca Parisiensia, II, p. 306–10: “Heliodorus writes in iambic verse a composition on gold for the same Theodosius”; and Theodosius Melitenus, ed. Tafel, p. 73, var. 4, who incorrectly confuses him with the author of the Aethiopica). Certainly, the Byzantines of the 11th century, to whom belong the codices Marcianus 299 and Laurentianus 28, 34 (cod. 12, fol. 164), made no distinction between Heliodorus the chemist and Heliodorus, commentator on Paulus, but called both equally “Heliodorus the philosopher.” The codices always show that the secret sciences of alchemy and astrology were previously allied (cf. Paris. 2419), and this is otherwise well known (cf. Usener, De Stephano Alexandrino, 1879, p. 9). — F. C.]

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Synousiai" (συνουσίαι) is left untranslated here because of its specialized usage; possibilities include "assemblies," "meetings," or "conjunctions," but it also appears as a title or category of Heliodorus's astrological works.

^2🤖 "Stirigmoi" (στηρίγμοι) is transliterated and glossed, as it is an uncommon technical term in this context, likely referring to "supports" or "foundations" in an astrological sense.

^3🤖 Rendered as "dispossession," but alternate meanings, such as "forfeiture," could be possible depending on the specific astrological context.

^4🤖 "Denial" (or "ablation" in some translations) represents a technical astrological concept of denying or preventing a certain outcome; the Greek term should be checked in context.
