CODICES FLORENTINI

in a later hand: *Apotelesmatica of various authors, for which an index is found on the following page*; (f. 2: an incomplete Latin index of those items contained in the codex); f. 1r, no. 14; upper margin of f. 2, no. 605 in agricultural literature (lit. agr.) no. 204, which latter number we read repeated a little later. Names of manuscript owners: f. 2, formerly Angelo Poliziano. Found among the books of Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.

F. 2. ...Cronos (Saturn), also called Phaenon, completes his own cycle in thirty years according to his own motion—he completes his cycle as the most remote; he is conjoined with the Sun for thirty years.

F. 2v. If you know that the Sun, after entering each zodiac sign, passes through one degree each day—and wherever you arrive, in that sign in the zodiac will the Moon be. Canon, upper margin: ascendant (horoskopos). If you wish to see in which zodiac sign the Sun is located—he reaches 21° 10', where they say the Sun is.

F. 3v. Explanation concerning the tritynes¹ (tertians) of the twelve zodiac signs and their exaltations (Aries is the house of Mars; the Sun is exalted at 19 degrees—find the ascendant; that which is the diameter, again, is the descendent).

F. 4. Concerning those casting horoscopes (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo—the lesser of the evils). The Sun, Aphrodite (Venus), and Hermes (Mercury) traverse the zodiac in one period—that is, in 17 hours. As the Sun enters the zodiac signs, the signs change thus—Cancer, Capricorn, Pisces: dangerous.

F. 4r. <Astrological poem of John Kamateros (Johannes Camaterus)>² (From the heavenly archetypes, a book for you—and of those who hold power among the houses of kings). In the year 6769 (perhaps the 6769th year; i.e., A.D. 1261), April 5, hour 1: eclipse of the Sun—October 19, hour 5: eclipse of the Sun | On December 31 of the fifteenth indiction, numeral 23—eastern Eoi <corr. to ἐὠοι>.

F. 9v. The poem of Kamateros, interrupted, here resumes: dissolution brings bodily fear—If evils increase, say more of the evils.

F. 10. Index of those items written from f. 18 onward [annotation: whenever you want the chapters on eclipses, seek these ten in this table: 22, 67, 113, 151, 159, 425, 431, 451, 458.]

F. 10v. Continuation of Kamateros's poem: If, however, you do not introduce it according to the same aspect—if the lot of fortune falls in the tenth house.

F. 17. The same. Together with the principal figure of the examined [houses]—it gives profit.

¹ Tritynes (tertians): divisions of zodiacal signs; see astrological terminology.
