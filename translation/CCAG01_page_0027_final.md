CODICES FLORENTINI

in a recent hand: * Apotelesmatica by various authors, for which an index is given on the following page; (fol. 2 contains an unfinished Latin index for those works found in the codex); fol. 1r no. 14; fol. 2, at the top margin, no. 605 in agricultural literature no. 204, which latter number is repeated shortly thereafter. Name of previous owners of the codices: fol. 2, formerly Angelo Poliziano. Found among the books of Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.

Fol. 2. ‚Ä¶ Cronos, who is also <Ph>ain≈çn^1ü§ñ, completes his own circuit in 30 years according to his proper motion‚Äîcompletes his circuit as the outermost planet; he is conjoined with the Sun for 30 years.

Fol. 2v. If you should know that, after entering each zodiac sign, the Sun traverses one degree each day‚Äîand wherever you pause, there in that sign is the Moon. Canon, at the top margin: horoskopos^2ü§ñ. If you wish to know in which zodiac sign the Sun is found‚Äîit concludes at 21, œá; in which they say the Sun is.

Fol. 3v. Interpretation concerning the triplicities of the twelve zodiac signs and their exaltations (Aries is the house of Ares [Mars]^3ü§ñ; the Sun is exalted at 19 degrees‚Äîif you have found the ascendant, it is diametrically opposite, thus the setting point).

Fol. 4. On the ascendants (Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo‚Äîamong the less malefic signs). The Sun, Aphrodite [Venus], and Hermes [Mercury]^4ü§ñ traverse the zodiac signs within the space of one year‚Äîthat is, in 17 hours^5ü§ñ. When the Sun enters the zodiac signs, the signs change in this order‚ÄîCancer, Capricorn, Pisces are malefic.

Fol. 4r. <Johannes Camaterus>^6ü§ñ Astrological Poem (‚ÄúFrom celestial archetypes to you, a book‚Äîand concerning the powerful among the courts of kings‚Äù). Year 6979 (which, if calculated according to the Byzantine era, corresponds to A.D. 1471)^7ü§ñ, April 5th; first hour: eclipse of the Sun‚ÄîOctober 19th, fifth hour: eclipse of the Sun | On the 31st of December, in the 15th indiction (?), 23rd‚Äîmen of the East^8ü§ñ.

Fol. 9v. Camaterus‚Äôs poem, previously interrupted, continues: ‚ÄúAmid dissolution, it gives bodily fear‚ÄîIf misfortunes increase, say more of the evils.‚Äù^9ü§ñ

Fol. 10. Index of those works written from fol. 18 onward [there: note: whenever you require chapters on eclipses, seek these ten in this table: 22, 67, 119, 151, 159, 222, 231, 451, 458^10ü§ñ.]

Fol. 10v. Continuation of Camaterus‚Äôs poem: ‚Äúif not for that same configuration, it concerns‚Äîin the tenth place the Lot, if fortune falls.‚Äù

Fol. 17. The same. ‚ÄúWith the principal configuration of the select ones‚Äîit gives profit.‚Äù
