114 FLORENTINE MANUSCRIPTS

…the apokyntic hour, at the time of old age, bestows successes and happiness upon the one born, and from great enhancing influences they are fortunate—for the place is obscure—and their deaths, moreover, become illustrious and widely known; for from this same place is also inferred the posthumous transformation of the body.

These considerations, then, we have set forth with regard to what pertains to the axiom of fortune.^1🤖 For, generally speaking, whenever a bright star arises at the ascendant for any person—or even when one happens to be at the center and the Moon is configured, as we said before, with one of the bright and notable stars—at the apokyntic hour, that person will have a splendid and remarkable life.

But since their natures have the greatest, most marvelous, and most varied power, and since the difference brought about by their locations is significant, it is necessary for us to set forth what peculiar properties with respect to them have been handed down from our predecessors;

for according to the manner in which each of the fixed stars has an affinity with the planets and with their analogous temperaments, in the same way each of the planets is able and actually brings about similar effects, as even Syphaios himself says. For it is not only necessary to consider the mixture of the Five Stars^2🤖, the Sun, and the Moon with each other, but also their combinations with those of the same nature among the fixed stars, according to the preserved, demonstrated, and recorded affinities with the planets as set down in the table, just as their qualities are able to produce and actually bring about similar effects.

We have also found this usage among a very few of the ancients, chiefly among those who philosophized about this part of prediction and about the science of the divinity of numbers; these, among the ancients, presented knowledge and qualities of the phenomena more in a scattered and obscure manner.

We, however, wishing to leave a record for ourselves to those worthy of the study of the stars, have drawn from the astronomical canon only those things which [Ptolemy] set forth as useful in the astronomical art, and we have eagerly undertaken and have first fashioned a newer and more commendable arrangement of the table, comprising all wisdom and knowledge of heavenly things, as follows:

^1🤖 The phrase “axiom of fortune” (περὶ τύχης ἀξιωματικῆς) is a technical term referring to the astrological principle or rule governing fortune or luck. Alternatives might include “doctrine of fortune” or “the authoritative principle concerning fortune.”
^2🤖 The “Five Stars” (τῶν ἐ’ ἀστέρων) is a standard ancient designation for the five planets visible to the naked eye—Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury—distinct from the Sun and Moon. Also, calling the planets “wandering stars” as opposed to “fixed stars” (ἁπλανεῖς ἀστέρες) follows ancient astronomical terminology.
