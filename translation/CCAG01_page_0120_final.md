114 FLORENTINE MANUSCRIPTS

…the “apokyntic” hour, at the period of old age, grants successes and good fortunes to the one born, and through great parathetike*[1] they prosper—for the place is obscure—and, moreover, their deaths too become distinguished and widely known; for from this place also is apprehended the posthumous coming-into-being of the body.

These matters we have indeed discussed in the section concerning the axiom of fortune. In general, for all people, whoever is born at the rising of a bright star, or even when another occupies the center and the Moon makes contact[2]—as we have previously stated—with some one of the bright and notable stars, during the “apokyntic” hour, will have a splendid and illustrious life.

Now, since their natural influence is greatest, most wondrous, and manifold, and since the difference arises according to the places, it is therefore necessary to set forth the particular natures which have been conserved by the ancients concerning these [stars];

for, according to the way in which each of the fixed stars has a conjunction (synoikeiosis)[3] with the planets and with their similar mixtures, each of the planets is both capable of and does produce the same effects, as Syphaios*[4] himself also says; for it is necessary not only to consider the mixture of the five stars, the Sun, and the Moon with one another, but also with those of the fixed stars sharing the same nature, in accordance with their preserved and demonstrated and inscribed synoikeiosis with the planets, as shown in the table—just as, among their qualities, being able to produce the same effects.

We have found this teaching also in very few others among the ancients on the subject of the fixed stars, but most of all among those who philosophized about this part of prognostication and the science of the divinity of numbers; these, among the ancients, have set out the understanding and qualities of the phenomena in a rather scattered and obscure manner.

But we, wishing to leave a remembrance for ourselves among those worthy of the stars, have transferred from the astronomical canon only so much as [Ptolemy] set forth as useful in the astronomical art, and we have also sought out and for the first time drawn up a newer and more praiseworthy arrangement of the table, containing all wisdom and knowledge of celestial things, as follows:

---

[1] parathetike (παραθητικῶν): The Greek here is corrupt and the precise sense is unclear; sometimes glossed as "substitution," but the true meaning is uncertain.
[2] "the Moon makes contact": The Greek term is ambiguous and may refer to astrological aspects or conjunction.
[3] synoikeiosis (συνοικείωσις): A Greek technical term signifying a conjunction or mutual indwelling between celestial bodies.
[4] Syphaios: The reference is to a person mentioned in the manuscript whose identification is uncertain; see also p. 80, line 9, for further discussion.

Errata and textual apparatus:  
1 “apokyntic”: ms.; “old age”: ms.  
2 “to the one born”: ms.; “parathetikon”: corrupt. Perhaps “through great parathetikon.”  
6 “in general”: ms.  
7 “whoever”: “the one who” ms.; “bright star”: ms.; “at the center”: ms.  
8 “in some”: cf. Kroll’s correction; ms.  
12 “concerning”: ms., emended by Kroll.  
12 “influence”: ms.  
14 “their”: ms., emended by Kroll; “particular natures”: ms.; cf. Syphaios—name unknown, cf. p. 80, l. 9, Ephai.  
22 “from those who bring to an end”: ms.  
24 “philosophized”: ms.; “this part”: Kroll emendation.  
25 “numbers”: μ superscript; above “science of the divinity” three dots—something may be missing, hence “science” not emended.  
26 “obscure”: ms.  
27 “for ourselves” instead of “for themselves” (cf. Kroll and Marquardt, praef. Galeni, I p. XLIV), though the sense seems to require the former.  
29 “only”: deleted by Kroll; but “astronomical” seems unique in Ptolemy’s language. “Ptolemy” gloss rejected. “in”: added.  
32 Perhaps <thus (δεικνυμένου)>. After "as follows" there formerly followed a table, now missing.
