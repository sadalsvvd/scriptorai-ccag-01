LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “It remains in all things unwavering” renders a technical astrological phrase; “unwavering” could also be interpreted as “unaffected.”  
^2🤖 “Those abstaining remove [scil. something]” refers to therapeutic dietary or procedural absences, left purposefully vague in the original; see similar usages in Greek medical texts.  
^3🤖 “Canonion” denotes a canonical rule, table, or schedule—especially in astrological or esoteric contexts; see further in manuscript and Hermetic literature.  
^4🤖 The notation “mōsa′” and “ml′” is preserved as in the manuscript. Their precise interpretation may depend on context or further palaeographical analysis; they likely refer to abbreviation or number systems employed in astrological practice.
