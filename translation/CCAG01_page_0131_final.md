APPENDIX

For if the event concerns his own triangle or house, the physician will be a native and not a foreigner; but if it is in foreign places, the physician will be a foreigner. Dorotheus also says that these configurations are dangerous, such as the weekly and nine-day periods of the climacterics; for if the days counted from the patient’s own birth to the crisis, when divided by seven come to seven, or when divided by nine come to nine, then that crisis will be a climacteric one for that nativity. Or, if the illness begins, it will be dangerous.

And the same author also says to observe this: taking the number of zodiacal signs from the natal Sun to the natal Moon—inclusive of the signs each luminary initially occupies^1🤖—then, having ascertained this number, also count the days from birth to the crisis, and divide by the number of zodiacal signs as just described. If this number perfectly divides into the total days, the one who reaches crisis will become dangerously ill.

He also says to further consider the Moon at the time of crisis; for if it happens to be in the fourth, seventh, eighth, or its original natal place, this signifies the illness will be dangerous, and such indications are confirmed by other factors. It is also necessary, he says, to observe both Suns—the one at the nativity (birth chart) and the one at the progression (transit)^2🤖—and in addition, the Moon at the time of the crisis; and if that Moon squares either Sun before it comes into conjunction^3🤖, it signifies a lighter illness; but if conjunction comes before the square, the prognosis is worse.

Julianus adds the following: those who are ill will die, he says, whose lights have been harmed in the places of eclipses, or in whose case Saturn and Mars, being in the places of eclipses, have testified against the lights, especially when the illness is pestilential. The same occurs in cases of those at war or at sea, for they perish en masse. And if the inception of the event is under such a configuration—by whirlwind, fire, flood, or great storm—it signifies communal destruction. And if a comet, torch-like star, or something similar should appear***.

And in tropical signs, when Saturn and Mars are established...

^1🤖 That is, counting inclusively the zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun and the Moon at birth—not only the intervening signs, but also their initial positions. This is a technical counting method in Hellenistic astrology.

^2🤖 The distinction between "the Sun at the nativity" (Greek: κατὰ πήξιν) and "the Sun at the progression" (Greek: κατὰ πάροδον) refers, respectively, to the position of the Sun in the original birth chart versus its position at the time of the crisis (event/progression). Some translators render these as "fixed" or "figure" versus "transit"; here, "nativity" (birth) and "progression" (transit) are used for clarity.

^3🤖 "Comes into conjunction" means "joins" in astrological language; the Moon "squaring" (90° aspect) a luminary before conjunction with it was considered significant for prognosis. If the square comes before the conjunction, the outcome is less favorable; if after, the illness is lighter.
