APPENDIX

For if the native is in his own triangle or house, the physician will be native and not foreign; but if he is in foreign places, the physician will be foreign. Dorotheus also says that these configurations are dangerous, such as the weekly and enneadic (nine-day) climacteric periods; for, he says, if the days reckoned from the patient's own birth until the crisis, when divided by seven, the result is seven, or when divided by nine, the result is nine, that nativity will experience a climacteric; or if the patient begins to fall ill, he will fall seriously ill.

Dorotheus also says to consider the following: taking from the natal Sun to the natal Moon the number of their zodiacal intervals, including the very signs in which both luminaries are at the beginning, therefore, having as stated this number of zodiacal signs, also take the number of days from the nativity to the crisis, and divide these by the number of zodiacal signs, as stated; and if this number divides exactly into the number of days, the patient at the crisis will fall seriously ill.

He also says in another way: observe the Moon at the time of crisis; for if it happens to be in the 4th, 7th, or 8th place from the nativity, or where the natal Moon was at the start, the illness is dangerous, and these conditions also indicate as much. It is also necessary, he says, to consider both Suns—the one determined (natal) and the one by transit—and furthermore the transiting Moon at the crisis; and if this Moon itself, before making a quadrature (square), joins one of the Suns, it indicates a milder illness; but if before joining one of the Suns she makes a quadrature, the sign is unfavorable.

Julian adds the following: those patients whose luminaries are afflicted in the places of eclipse, or upon whom Saturn and Mars, being in those places, bear witness against the luminaries, especially in pestilential (epidemic) illnesses, will die, he says; the same also occurs for those in war and for those at sea, for they perish en masse. And if the beginning takes place at such a configuration during a whirlwind, or fire, or flood, or great storm, it signifies general destruction. And if a comet, a beam (torch), or something similar should appear***.

And in the tropical signs, Saturn and Mars being positioned—

***Errata: κομήτης ἢ δοκίς ἢ τι τοιοῦτο φανεῖ — “comet, or torch, or something of that sort, should appear.”
