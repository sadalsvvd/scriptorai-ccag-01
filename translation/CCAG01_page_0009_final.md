I. CODICES CONTAINING ASTROLOGICAL WORKS  
OF INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS

1. Laurentianus, Plut. 28, codex 7. — Paper manuscript, 14th century, folios 1–176. Cf. Bandini, *Catalogus codicum graecorum bibliothecae Laurentianae* II (1768), p. 16.

After the astronomical works of Theon, Ptolemy, Proclus, and Geminus, one finds:

Folio 146. *Introduction to Apotelesmatics* by Paul of Alexandria. The proemium begins: “Very well, dear son of Kronos.”^1🤖 Ends: “in the risings of the signs.” The book begins: “The zodiacal circle moves obliquely, divided into twelve sections.” Ends: “their domiciles are named after the signs themselves.” — Edited with translation by Andreas Schatton, Wittenberg, 1586. Cf. Fabricius-Harles, *Bibliotheca graeca* IV, p. 139.

Folio 170. *Exposition and Solution* by Rhetorius concerning the previously mentioned twelve signs of the zodiac and other various matters from the treasures of Antiochus. Begins: “For what reason the twelve signs came to exist in a circuit.” Ends: “the violent events effected among men.” Cf. infra, codex 12, folio 84r.

Next, on folio 175, follow two tables presenting a comparison between the months of the Romans and those of the Arabs, etc.

2 — Plut. 28, codex 17. — Paper manuscript in small quarto, 14th century, folios 1–243. Cf. Bandini, loc. cit., p. 34.

*Persian Compilation of Astronomy.* Begins: “This book is called a ‘compilation’ by the Greeks, but in the dialect of the Persians it lives [i.e., exists, is known, or is called so]^2🤖. Thus, from the account of Sampsouchares, a man by birth a Persian … I have received the instruction.” Ends: “… sheep, monkey^3🤖, bird, dog, pig.” At the end is noted: “year ζωλα [zōla], from Alexander, αχλδʹ [1434] (= 1323 CE).”^4🤖 — The beginning has been edited by Usener, *Ad historiam astronomiae symbola* [Contributions to the History of Astronomy], Bonn, 1876, p. 22ff.

Although this work pertains more to natural than to judicial astrology^5🤖, we include it here because a not unuseful fragment of it will be quoted below.

3 — Plut. 28, codex 20. — Paper manuscript, 21 × 15 cm, 14th century, folios 1–267. On the first page is written: “Formerly found among the books of Lorenzo de’ Medici, among the books of Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola”; cf. Bandini, loc. cit., p. 38.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Kronos” is the standard mythological form; the Greek address ὦ φίλε παῖ Κρονάμων is conventionally translated this way. The technical term “Apotelesmatics” (ἀποτελεσματική) refers specifically to astrology concerned with effects or nativities.

^2🤖 The Greek verb “ζῇ” can mean “lives,” “exists,” or “is named/called.” Some manuscripts and translations prefer “is called” to emphasize title usage. Both interpretations are possible here.

^3🤖 The animal is generally rendered “monkey” in scholarly translations; some catalogues use “baboon,” but “monkey” is the less specific and safer choice.

^4🤖 The year ζωλα, from Alexander (i.e., the Seleucid era), αχλδʹ = 1434 Seleucid, which corresponds to 1323 CE. The Greek numerals have been given in Romanized form and with the modern equivalent for clarity.

^5🤖 “Natural astrology” refers to predictions about weather, climate, and phenomena of nature, as opposed to “judicial astrology,” which concerns individual human destinies and events.
