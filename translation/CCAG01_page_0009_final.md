I. MANUSCRIPTS WHICH CONTAIN THE ASTROLOGICAL WORKS OF INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS

1. Laurentianus, Plut. 28, cod. 7. — Paper manuscript, 14th century, fols. 176. Cf. Bandini, Catalogus codicum graecorum bibliothecae Laurentianae, vol. II, 1768, p. 16.

After the astronomical works of Theon, Ptolemy, Proclus, and Geminus, the following are found:

Fol. 146. Introduction to the Apotelesmatics by Paul of Alexandria. Proemium begins: "Πάνυ καλῶς, ὦ φίλε παῖ Κρονάμων" (“Very well, O dear son of Kronos”). Ends: "ἐν ταῖς τῶν Ζωδίων ἀναφοραῖς" (“in the risings of the Zodiac signs”). The book begins: "Ὁ ζῳδιακὸς κύκλος κινείται λοξῶς, διηρημένος εἰς τμήματα ιβʹ" (“The zodiacal circle moves obliquely, divided into twelve sections”). Ends: "οἰκητήρια αὐτῶν αὐτὰ τὰ Ζῳδια κατωνόμασται" (“their domiciles are in fact called the zodiacal signs themselves”). — Edited with the translation of Andreas Schatton, Wittenberg, 1586. Cf. Fabricius-Harles, Bibliotheca graeca, vol. IV, p. 139.

Fol. 170. Exposition and solution by Rhetorius concerning both the aforementioned twelve signs of the Zodiac and various other matters from the treasures of Antiochus. Begins: "Τίνως ἕνεκα τῶν ιβʹ ζωδίων κυκλοειδῶς τετυχηκότων" (“For what reason the twelve signs of the zodiac have appeared in a circle”). Ends: "Τὰ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἀποτελούμενα βίαια πράγματα" (“the violent acts brought about among men”). Cf. below, cod. 12, fol. 84r.

Following, on fol. 175, are two tables presenting the months of the Romans and the Arabs compared with one another, etc.

2 — Plut. 28, cod. 17. — Paper manuscript in small quarto, 14th century, fols. 243. Cf. Bandini, loc. cit., p. 34.

Persian compilation of astronomy. Begins: "Τὸ βιβλίον τόδε καθ’ Ἕλληνας μὲν σύνταξις λέγεται, κατὰ δὲ τὴν τῶν Περσῶν διάλεκτον ζῇ. Ἀπὸ φωνῆς τοίνυν τοῦ Σαμψουχάρης ἀνδρὸς τὸ γένος Πέρσου ... τὴν διδασκαλίαν ἀκήκοα." (“This book, according to the Greeks, is called ‘Compilation’, but according to the dialect of the Persians, it endures. From the voice, then, of Sampsucharēs, a man of the Persian race, ... I have heard the teaching.”). Ends: "... πρόβατον, μαιμὼ, ὄρνις, κύων, χοῖρος." (“... sheep, baboon, bird, dog, pig.”) At the end is noted: "ἔτους ζωλα, ἀπ’ Ἀλεξάνδρου, αχλδʹ" (= 1323 AD). — The beginning is published by Usener, Ad historiam astronomiae symbola, Bonn, 1876, p. 22 ff.

We mention this work here, though it pertains more to natural than to judicial astrology, because we will cite a fragment of it below.

3 — Plut. 28, cod. 20. — Paper manuscript, 21 × 15 cm, 14th century, fols. 267. On the first page is written: *Formerly belonging to Lorenzo de’ Medici, found among the books of Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola*; cf. Bandini, loc. cit., p. 38.
