...the light is diminished, and the day becomes shorter. Again, for what reason is it that wherever Zeus is exalted, there Ares^1🤖 is diminished, and wherever Ares is exalted, there Zeus is diminished? We say that Zeus is the overseer^2🤖 of the vital spirit^3🤖 and dominion, whereas Ares is of death. Thus, wherever the vital spirit increases, the principle^4🤖 of death is diminished; and wherever death increases, life is diminished. Again, for what reason is it that wherever Aphrodite^1🤖 is exalted, there Hermes is diminished, and wherever Hermes is exalted, there Aphrodite is diminished? We say that Hermes is lord of the rational principle^5🤖, and Aphrodite is overseer of desire and union^6🤖. Therefore, wherever the rational principle prevails, the desiring and pleasurable aspect of union is diminished, and wherever the appetitive and pleasurable aspect is exalted, there the rational principle is diminished. Why is it, then, that wherever the Moon is exalted, none is diminished, and wherever the Moon is diminished, none is exalted? We say that the Moon is the Fortune of all^7🤖; and whomever Fortune exalts, none can diminish, and whomever Fortune diminishes, none can exalt.

8. Concerning the Oppositions of the Stars.

Why is it that the houses^8🤖 of the Sun and the Moon are opposed to the houses of Kronos^1🤖? We say that the Sun and the Moon are the luminaries of the cosmos, whereas Kronos is lord of darkness; whence always light is opposed to darkness, and darkness to light. Again, for what reason are the houses of Hermes opposed to the houses of Zeus, and the houses of Zeus to the houses of Hermes? We say that Zeus is the overseer of wealth and dominion, and Hermes always the lord of words; thus, the rational principle is always opposed to and looks down upon^9🤖 desire for wealth, and dominion is opposed to reason. Why again, then, are the houses of Ares opposed to the houses of Aphrodite? We say that Aphrodite is overseer of all desire and delight and pleasure, whereas Ares is of all fear and war and anger; therefore, the delightful and desirous and pleasurable is always opposed to the fearful and wrathful and warlike. That this is so, and that it is necessary, according to truth, so to judge in all the principal points^10🤖 the natures of the stars with regard to their configurations^11🤖 with one another.
