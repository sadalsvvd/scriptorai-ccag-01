...less so for rain. Whenever, then, one of these three—namely, the Moon, Venus, or Hermes—enters one of the aforementioned signs, it produces rainfall; and if also Venus is in conjunction with the other two, all being present in one of these signs, there occurs a great rainfall, though not a harmful one; [if indeed it tends toward destruction, in any event, if Venus is in the configuration previously mentioned, the rain is slower and lesser.] But whenever Venus and the Moon are separated from Hermes in one of these signs, the rainfall is proportionate and beneficial; and whenever only the Moon is present and receives the testimony of Venus or Hermes, the rainfall is good. If, however, the Moon does not receive testimony, and these planets themselves are in one of the aforementioned signs, there is rainfall until the Moon departs from the sign it occupies. Venus, Hermes, and the Moon, when they are apart from the testimony, presence, or return of the malefics, signify rainfall; but whenever the testimony or return is with the malefics or alongside them, there is no rainfall. Venus, the Moon, and Hermes, when all three are present together in one of these signs at a suitable time, are harmed by the malefics; toward the rising it rains; these stars, when joined with the malefics, produce intermittent rainfall. Venus, in giving testimony to the aforementioned, is more powerful than when she is in conjunction. And whenever Venus or Hermes is in Virgo and the Moon is in Taurus or Scorpio or Pisces, there is rainfall; likewise, whenever the said stars are in one of the rainy signs and Venus and Hermes are under the rays or retrograde, they do not produce rainfall. And whenever the Moon is in Taurus or in Virgo and Venus quickly passes her, without the testimony of the malefics, it rains that very day, especially if the Moon is with the ascending one; but when with the descending one or without the testimony of Saturn, with Venus and Mars and Hermes being in the tropical signs, it rains. Therefore, observe at the turn of the year, that is, whenever the Sun enters the first degree of Capricorn, how Venus and Hermes are situated; and if they are in one of the aforementioned or rainy signs, and the malefics do not aspect them, the
