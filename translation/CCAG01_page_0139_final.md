…it is less so for rain. Therefore, whenever one of these three enters the aforementioned zodiacal signs, it produces rainfall; and if Venus too makes an ingress to these two when they are both present in any one of these signs, there occurs a great rain, though not a harmful one.

^1🤖 The phrase references a situation where, if the configuration would produce destructive rain, the presence of Venus slows and lessens the rainfall.  
^2🤖 “Malefic planets” in Hellenistic astrology refers specifically to Mars and Saturn.  
^3🤖 “Under the beams” indicates planetary proximity to the Sun (combustion), while “retrograde” (ἀναποδιστικοί) is a technical term for reverse planetary motion.  
^4🤖 “Temporal signs” likely refers to signs associated with seasonal change (“chronikos” in Greek), often the tropical cardinal signs; further context in the treatise may clarify this nuance.
