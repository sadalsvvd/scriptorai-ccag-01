LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The section heading "Otherwise" translates Greek Ἄλλως; it may signal "Further," "Alternatively," or mark a new division or variant tradition in the original manuscripts.

^2🤖 "sqr." is retained from the manuscript as an abbreviation (likely for Latin "sequitur," meaning "it follows"), indicating the continuation of a theme or title.

^3🤖 "The Moon void of course" is a technical astrological term (Greek: Σελήνη κενοδρομοῦσα), describing a lunar state in which the Moon makes no further aspects before leaving a sign. Alternative literal renderings are "the Moon coursing void" or "the Moon running void."
