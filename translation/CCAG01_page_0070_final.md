LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Inception” translates καταρχή (katarche), a technical term in Hellenistic astrology meaning the inception or starting moment of an event, often in electional astrology. Alternate translations could be “commencement,” “initiative,” or “election,” but “inception” is most neutral.
^2🤖 The phrase indicates both the idiosyncratic effects of each zodiac sign and their relationship to specific positions (“places”) in the zodiac, a crucial factor in astrological judgments.
^3🤖 “Lord of the Horoscope” refers to the planetary ruler of the rising sign (ascendant) at the moment of the inception.
^4🤖 The Sun, along with the Moon, is often termed one of the “lights” in astrological parlance—principal luminaries of the chart.
^5🤖 “Lord” here refers contextually to the lord of the ascendant or relevant house.
^6🤖 “Benefic things” refers to benefic planets or influences (“benefic” is a technical term for planets considered favorable: Jupiter and Venus, primarily).
^7🤖 “Lights” means the Sun and Moon in astrological technical language.
^8🤖 “Ruling star” similarly means the planetary ruler most closely associated with the inception.
^9🤖 The Moon is pivotal in electional astrology, often used to judge the success or difficulty of an inception.
^10🤖 “Lords of the houses” are the planetary rulers of the astrological “houses” which structure the chart and interpret events.
^11🤖 “Angles” (Greek: ἀγωνία) are the four primary points of the horoscope chart: ascendant, descendant, midheaven, and IC; they have special power in astrological interpretation.
^12🤖 The ellipsis “[…]” reflects a lacuna (gap) in the manuscript; the precise condition for generating wealth is missing or damaged.
^13🤖 “Atorasia” (Ἀτορασία) is an obscure or possibly technical term; its exact meaning is unknown and may be unique to this text.
