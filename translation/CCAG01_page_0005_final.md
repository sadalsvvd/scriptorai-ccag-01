PREFACE

Nor will we be denied indulgence if, in this unexplored subject, some obscurities may remain, and our edition at times may seem not to be faultless in every respect. We admit that it is possible that many passages of this edition could be emended from other manuscripts, but if we had wanted to proceed to establish the text only after having marshaled every aid, this work would have appeared either too late or not at all. “Half is more than the whole.”^1🤖 Thus, as things stand, we are confident that the booklet will not prove entirely useless. Posterity will use it toward better things.

To the scholars who have generously lent us their efforts, I must now, willingly and deservedly, offer the thanks that are due. Hermann Usener, a veteran of these studies, most liberally offered me ample excerpts from his inexhaustible collections; Richard Wuensch granted us two Laurentian fragments as well as emendations and annotations; Joseph Bidez, while residing in Rome and Florence, spent many hours, out of kindly regard for me, examining astrological volumes; through the intercession of Aeneas Piccolomini and Christian Huelsen, Cerocchi, a diligent young man, most accurately transcribed for my use several chapters of the Angelican codex—extraordinarily difficult to read; in cooperation, one of us has often been assisted by another, but we are especially indebted to Wilhelm Kroll, who was willing to undertake with us the laborious task of correcting proofs and, from his own notes, removed numerous errors both in the description of manuscripts and in the edition of excerpts.

Written at Brussels, on the Ides of August, 1898.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖: The Greek proverb “Πλέον ἥμισυ παντός” (cf. Hesiod, Works and Days 40) is commonly rendered “Half is more than the whole,” conveying the paradox that sometimes a partial achievement is preferable to an unattainable complete one. Alternative translations include “The half is greater than the whole.”
