PREFACE

Nor will pardon be denied us if, in an unexplored subject, some things remain obscure, and our edition may sometimes appear not entirely complete in all respects. We admit it is possible that many passages in this edition could be restored from other manuscripts, but if we had wished to proceed to establish the text only once provided with every resource, this work would have appeared either late or never. “The half is more than the whole.” Thus, as the little book stands, we trust it will not be altogether useless. Future generations will use it for better purposes.

I must gladly and deservedly render due thanks to the scholars who have kindly offered me their help. Hermann Usener, a veteran of these studies, generously offered me a substantial selection from his inexhaustible collection; Richard Wuensch imparted to us two Laurentian fragments, emendations, and annotations; Joseph Bidez, while staying in Rome and Florence, out of kindness toward me, spent many hours examining astrological volumes; through the intercession of Aeneas Piccolomini and Christian Huelsen, Cerocchi, a diligent young man, accurately transcribed for my use several chapters of the Angelican book, which is extremely difficult to read. It is fitting, in scholarly cooperation, that one of us is often assisted by another; but we are especially indebted to Wilhelm Kroll, who accepted the trouble of correcting proofs with us and, from his notes, removed many errors both in the description of manuscripts and in the edition of extracts.

Written at Brussels, on the Ides of August, 1898.
