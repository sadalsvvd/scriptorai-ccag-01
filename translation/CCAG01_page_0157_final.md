LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "in youth; but in the third" begins mid-sentence, following context from the previous page. The translation maintains the parallel structure of the Greek, which uses temporal adverbs and conjunctions to structure the life stages and their results. The Greek "πλουτήσει" means "he will become wealthy," but can also simply be "he prospers," depending on context. Such nuances are retained throughout the translation.
