κζʹ (27). From the Ἀποτελεσματικά (Apotelesmatics)^1 of Hephaestion of Thebes and other ancient sources: concerning the nomenclature and powers of the twelve parts. — Chapters 27–66 (f. 75v) agree almost entirely with the chapters beginning “From the Apotelesmatics of Hephaestion of Thebes,” etc., preserved on folios 99–131v of codex 7, except that on f. 46v, “On the nature of the zodiacal signs” (Hephaestion of Thebes I, chapter 20), the statement ends: “Only the star of Kronos was assigned as ruler,” p. 79, l. 7 (Engelbrecht); and on f. 67v, “On the division of times,” it appears divided into the following sections: on the year; on the month; on the day. — The chapters “How one ought to examine the transfers,” etc. (f. 140) up to “On the month according to Nechepsos” (f. 148) of codex 7 are omitted. Chapters 67–87 (f. 77r–88v), which are in no way to be attributed to Hephaestion (for chapters 69 and 87 name Julian and the Syrian^2 as authors), likewise agree with codex 7, ff. 149–158v.

F. 88v. 88. How one might apprehend the inquiries of those wishing to investigate from a katarchē (inception)^3. Hephaestion — cod. 7, f. 159. — Chapters 89–101 — cod. 7, ff. 161v–162. Chapters 102–122 (f. 88v–100v) are again borrowed from Hephaestion and are likewise found in codex 7, ff. 162v–170r. But the fifth chapter of Book III (f. 92–95v) is indeed complete, but divided into two parts: the first, “On universal beginnings,” from the beginning up to the words “except at Full Moon and conjunction” — Studi ital. l.c., p. 22, l. 22 — the second, “On practical days and hours.” Incipit: “And the practical hours also,” ibid., up to the end of the chapter. — See the more detailed index in Studi ital. l.c. Chapters 103–108 (f. 100v–102r), which seem foreign to the books of Hephaestion (for already explained topics are taken up again), agree with codex 7, ff. 170v–171v.

F. 102r. 109. When it is necessary for a ruler or potentate to meet. Hephaestion — Of chapters 130–135 (ff. 102r–114r), few, I should think, are not by Hephaestion; you can find the titles and first and last words in Studi ital. l.c. Since these do not differ from those in codex 7, ff. 171v–182v [concerning fugitives], except in the smallest details, we have judged them to be passed over. Chapters 135–143 (f. 114r–170) similarly repeat almost word-for-word folios 182v–247 of codex 7. Thus, we have considered it sufficient to briefly note where one differs from the other: in place of the chapter [of Antiochus] “Concerning the lordship of each over others,” codex 7, f. 195, we find

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Ἀποτελεσματικά” is transliterated as “Apotelesmatics,” a technical term in ancient astrology denoting works concerned with astrological effects or outcomes; “Prognostics” is sometimes used, but “Apotelesmatics” preserves the technical specificity.

^2🤖 “The Syrian” reflects the manuscript attribution; the precise historical identity could refer to a known astrologer in the Syrian tradition, often named Syrius in other sources.

^3🤖 “Katarchē” is a technical term in Hellenistic astrology meaning “inception,” that is, the moment something begins (e.g., the founding of a city, start of a journey, etc.), but is distinct from “nativity” (birth chart); the Greek word is retained here for accuracy.
