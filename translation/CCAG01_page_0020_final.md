LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 “Criteria and accusation and victory and defeat”: The Greek has a textual variant for “defeat” (ἤττης [ἢ. ἤττης]), which can also be read as “loss.” Both readings are possible; “defeat” is more literal in legal/competitive contexts, while “loss” broadens the potential meaning.

^2🤖 “The statements of Dorotheus—on transferring the lost item from place to place”: The Greek may refer to a method of searching for lost property by moving or exchanging its location, as described in Dorotheus’ astrological texts.

^3🤖 “If it is unnecessary, only a part was lost”: The Greek is elliptical; an alternate reading is “if excessive, only a part was lost,” meaning that not everything was lost.

^4🤖 “The star of Zeus”: This refers to the planet Jupiter in classical astrological vocabulary, here associated with the appearance or detection of the thief.

^5🤖 “Escaping in tropical [signs]”: “Tropical signs” (τροπικοῖς) are astrological terms for the signs marking the equinoxes and solstices. The phrase means escaping or departing under these astrological conditions.

^6🤖 “Effluxes of the Moon”: Technical astrological term for the influences or emanations of the Moon.

^7🤖 “Fruitless and wanderers”: The Greek (ἅπρακτοι ... καὶ ῥέμβοι) may also be rendered “unsuccessful and aimless.”
