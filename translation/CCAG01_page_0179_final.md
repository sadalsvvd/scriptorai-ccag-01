Regarding the epithets of the twelve gods (which Studemund published in Anecdota varia, I, 264 along with the excerpts of Nicetas), they are nevertheless not completely useless, since they seem to have preserved rarer or novel terms from lost astrological writings. — Cf. codex Marcianus 313, 10th cent., in which, according to Zanetti (Graeca d. Marci Bibliotheca, p. 146), “are prefixed the epithets of the seven stars by Dorotheus of Sidon, τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀστέρων ὀνόματα ἐπίθετα, concerning which you will find more in the Venetian catalog.”
