LLM Translation Footnotes

1. “Mene” is a traditional name for the Moon in Greek myth, commonly used as one of Selene’s epithets.
2. †“Utterly-minded”: The Greek ὀλόφρων is rare and possibly means “of destructive mind” or “utterly resolved.” The manuscript reading is uncertain.
3. †“Judgment-sharp”: κρισιαχμής is unattested elsewhere; possible meanings include “sharp in judgment” or “decisive in battle.”
4. †“Well-breezed”: εὐπήνεμος could mean “having favorable winds” or “swift as the wind;” other readings suggest “good in war” (εὐπόλεμος).
5. “Lovely”: ἐρασμία can also be translated as “delightful,” “beloved,” or “inspiring love or affection.”
6. “Crafty”: The Greek connotes cleverness or ingenuity, matching Hermes’ mythic character; the epithet also plays on his name, Ἑρμείας.
7. “Tortoise-voiced”: χελυσσόστομος literally “with the voice (or mouth) of a tortoise,” alluding to Hermes’ invention of the lyre from a tortoise shell; alternate renderings include “tortoise-tongued” or “tortoise-mouthed.”
