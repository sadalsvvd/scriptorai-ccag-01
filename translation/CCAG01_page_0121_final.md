APPENDIX

So that, by deploying prolixity, we do not seem to obscure the clarity of the table, let us now proceed to set forth the productive power of each of the fixed stars, inscribing in the table also how many degrees each of them occupies in longitude—namely, in the consulship of Olybrius and Ausonius, since the fixed stars are shifted by 1 degree in 100 years toward the following of the tropical points, as the most divine Ptolemy has indicated—during which time we too composed this book; and of what temperament each is, and what latitude or wind each always occupies, we have set forth according to his tradition, so that we omit nothing from the instruction of the table. Let us therefore proceed to the exposition of the table.

All those who are born at the rising of Spica, the bright star in the left hand of Virgo, which is situated at the 29th degree of Virgo in the Zodiac...

He discusses Spica of Virgo, the stars of Lyra (Λύρα), Piscis Austrinus (the Southern Fish), Cygnus (the Bird), Corona Borealis (the Crown), and their relationship to Venus and Mars; then he proceeds (fol. 138v):

If Saturn happens to be present with any of these bright stars at the hour of birth, they become skilled in medicine and in the diagnosis or prognosis of secret books or rites, or very learned in mysteries; and if Jupiter is present with one of the aforementioned bright stars at the hour of birth, he bestows greater good fortune, honors or reputation, offices, or even rulership.

Moreover, different outcomes result in these cases: Spica produces hierophants, high priests, philosophers, or prophets of certain rites, and especially those born in Greece; and in the case of female births, if it is found, it makes priestesses of Demeter, the Mother of the Gods, Kore, or Isis, or women hierophants, skilled in mysteries or rites, possessing certain initiations, and greatly supported by the gods. And if at midheaven the bright star of the northern Crown is rising, it produces renowned persons: crown-bearers, chief priests, friends of kings, with strong bodies, illustrious and beloved by many.
