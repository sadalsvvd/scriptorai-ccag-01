APPENDIX

In order that we may not seem, by indulging in verbosity, to have obscured the clarity of the table, let us therefore begin to set forth the productive power^1🤖 of each of the fixed stars, after inscribing in the table how many degrees each occupies in longitude, as well as the consulship of Olybrius and Ausonius—for the fixed stars move one degree in 160 years into the next tropical sign, as the most divine Ptolemy has demonstrated—at which time we too composed this book, and what temperament each possesses, and what latitude or wind^2🤖 each continually occupies, following his tradition so that we might omit nothing of the teaching of the table. Let us, therefore, proceed to the exposition of the table.

Now, all those among men who are born at the rising of Spica, the bright star on the left hand^3🤖 of the Virgin, which is at the 29th degree of Virgo itself in the Zodiac...

The discourse treats of Spica of Virgo, the stars of Lyra (Λύρα), Piscis Austrinus (the great fish in the southern quarter), Cygnus (the Swan), Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown), and their relationship to Venus and Mars, and then continues (f. 138v):

If Saturn happens to be present with any of these same bright stars at the hour of birth, those born become skilled in the art of medicine and proficient in the interpretation of hidden books or are very learned in mysteries and rites; but if Jupiter observes at the hour of birth one of the aforesaid bright stars, greater fortunes, honors, and high offices—or even authority—are bestowed.

But even among these, there are certain differences: the star of Spica produces hierophants, highly honored priests, philosophers, or prophets of certain rites, and especially those born in Greece; and if found in female nativities^4🤖, it makes priestesses of Demeter, the Mother of the Gods, Kore, or Isis, or hierophantides, or those knowledgeable in mysteries or rites, or those who participate in certain initiations^5🤖 and are greatly aided by the gods. But if at the midheaven the bright star on the Northern Crown is present, it produces celebrated persons, crown-bearers, high priests, friends of kings, individuals who are strong in body and become renowned and loved by many.

Afterwards, the discourse concerns the power of the other stars. The following are enumerated: the star on the heart of Leo, Arcturus, the bright star of Aquila, Anta–

-------------------------
^1🤖 "Productive power" translates ποιητικῆς δυνάμεως, denoting a star's causal influence or efficacy in ancient astrological doctrine. "Efficacy" is an alternative rendering.

^2🤖 "Latitude or wind": Ancient astronomical texts assigned each star both a celestial latitude and an associated "wind," reflecting cosmological or meteorological concepts distinct from modern usage.

^3🤖 "Hand" here translates Greek χειρὸς for anatomical specificity; "arm" could also be considered but "hand" matches the traditional attribution for Spica.

^4🤖 "Female nativities" renders the technical astrological term for births with female horoscopes, indicating gender-specific effects in the ancient doctrines.

^5🤖 "Initiations" is used to reflect ancient Greek τελεταί or μυστήρια, meaning ceremonial or mystery rites; "ceremonial acts" is another possible rendering depending on context.
