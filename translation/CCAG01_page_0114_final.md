FLORENTINE MANUSCRIPTS

...they observed the Moon, being mistress over the Sun, the Ascendant, and Jupiter and Ares, and [saw] her, at the conjunction, being abased and afflicted; and in order that none of these configurations might be present, it was not sufficient for the Sun and the Ascendant and Jupiter to be found together at the same time.^1🤖 But how did they also overlook that passage in Dorotheus, where he says:

"But see both the great Sun and the mighty Moon,  
and the rulers of the houses wherein the two lights stand,  
the hour-marker over them, and the zodiac sign  
that touches the very middle of the sky, moving about within it—  
and as for the Moon, what place it holds among these, and who  
is her lord, into whose descending degrees she falls.  
For she, at the first points, is manifest in brilliant and beautiful actions;  
yet thereafter  
she deceives, *** and her end utterly vanishes."               [F. C.]

7 “at the summits” ms., corrected by Kroll. 8 “will touch the midheaven” ms. 9 “and indeed whoever” ms.  
τούτων is corrupt. 11 “she also” ms. 13 a lacuna indicated.

F. 127 (275v). ρηγ᾿. On how to produce white letters.

Take the thin white of an egg, with vinegar, and write in secret  
whatever you wish. Whenever you desire to reveal them, take a sponge with  
water and wash them off, then sprinkle pounded calaminth over them,  
and the letters will be revealed.^2🤖               [F. C.]

2 ὅς ms. λεπτὸν: perhaps λευκόν?

F. 135 (286). ρλδ’. What the stars signify when they fall  
in the places of the theme, according to Antiochus.

The Moon ruling the horoscope.  
Already at first among mortals she became mistress of the horoscope;  
and if the Moon *** approaches near to this,  
by night a great sign of life is securely accomplished;  
you will have abundant wealth and much profit,  
and long years of life; but if at the coming of  
the golden-bright dawn she sends contrary signs;  
and if evil ones are together with her, observing then—

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 The phrase "being abased and afflicted" translates the Greek ταπεινουμένην καὶ κακοδαιμονοῦσαν, literally "being humbled and possessed by an evil daimon"; "abased and afflicted" preserves both the technical and the metaphysical sense. On the phrase "to be found together at the same time," this renders the Greek ἐπὶ ταὐτοῦ, denoting simultaneous occupation of the configuration.

^2🤖 "White of an egg" translates "λευκὸν ᾠοῦ," more technical than "residue;" calaminth was a plant used in antique invisible ink formulas. The instruction to "wash them off" (ἀποπλύνον αὐτὰ) may refer to rinsing the invisible letters prior to dusting with calaminth, which causes the hidden writing to appear.
