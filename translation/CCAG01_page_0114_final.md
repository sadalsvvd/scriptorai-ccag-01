Already at first the Moon was ruler of mortals’ hour;  
and Selene was *** if she travels near this place,  
by night it is a great sign that the course of life is established;  
you will have much wealth and many profits,  
and many years of life; but if at dawn  
golden-bright she appears, then she sends contrary signs;  
but if evil ones are overseeing together, then
