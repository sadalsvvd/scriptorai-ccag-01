Even so, it removes [the effect], if no benefic is observing; but if a benefic is observing, it preserves those who have suffered affliction.

The Moon in aspect to Mars, if no benefic is overseeing, removes [the effect] up to the diameter^1🤖; but if a benefic is observing, from the first quadrature^2🤖 it preserves. The Moon in aspect to Mars and the Sun, if no benefic is intervening, causes affliction concerning the nerves and madness^3🤖 until it looses the connection^4🤖; but if, when the connection is loosed and it joins with a benefic as it moves toward the lesser [positions]^5🤖, it preserves the one who has fallen into the fourth period; but if it joins a malefic, namely Saturn, it does not preserve even up to the diameter. But if, moving toward the greater [positions], it connects with Saturn after the connection, it preserves the one in danger up to the diameter.

But if, in the stated manner, there is not even a middle [intervention], that is, until the Moon looses the connection and moves toward the lesser [positions], this is a mode of preservation.

But if, with the Moon moving toward the lesser [positions] in the same manner, Saturn and Hermes (Mercury)^6🤖 are configured, they lengthen the illness, working more to diminish than to remove it.

If there is an additive [aspect] by number and by light^7🤖, in whatever way the mind inclines toward the stars or the Moon^8🤖, they will incline downward until the Moon comes to the tenth sign from the inclining point; but if the Moon is unobserved by benefics or malefics, those who have become choleric in Libra resolve their diseases; but if only benefics and Hermes (Mercury) are configured in whatever way, up to the quadrature they dissolve the affliction; but by nature, in this sign, the diseases become intractable and malignant.

In Leo: the Moon in aspect to Saturn, if no benefic is overseeing, removes [the effect] up to the diameter; but if a benefic is overseeing, it preserves many after much affliction. The Moon in aspect to Mars, if no benefic observes, removes [the effect] up to the ninth [place]; but if a benefic observes, from the trigon (trine)^9🤖 it preserves what is in danger. The Moon in aspect to Mars and the Sun, with a numerically or luminously additive [aspect], certainly works a cardiac crisis^10🤖 up to the fifteenth interval; but on the square side, if it does not resolve with the number or even then increases at that time, Saturn, if configured, preserves.

The Moon alone and numerically subtractive^11🤖 preserves. The Moon in aspect to Jupiter and Venus, at the inclination or also when it comes to the quadrature, preserves. The Moon in aspect to Saturn and the Sun, moving toward the greater [positions] or even increasing, and especially when a benefic is also conjoined, from the quadrature it preserves; but if to the greater [positions] from the trigon of the ascendant, in all ways it preserves.

When the Moon is moving in the same manner and is carried toward the north, if Saturn and Hermes (Mercury), observing, observe, at first there is a good crisis, then a quartan fever; afterwards, they work in the mind in the abovementioned manner, with choler, and as long as it is observed with difficulty, it will be observed or increased, giving strength by the force of the light.

LLM Translation Footnotes

^1🤖 "Diameter" refers here to the opposition aspect (180°) in astrology.

^2🤖 "Quadrature" is the square aspect (90°) between planets.

^3🤖 The phrase "causes affliction concerning the nerves and madness" renders ancient terminology that may encompass a range of neurological or psychiatric disturbances; exact ancient nosology may differ from modern usage.

^4🤖 "Looses the connection" translates a technical term (σύνδεσμος, sundesmós) referring to the separation of an exact aspect between planets, especially the Moon.

^5🤖 "Lesser [positions]" and "greater [positions]" refer to the Moon moving toward signs, houses, or configurations considered astrologically of lesser or greater influence or strength.

^6🤖 Hermes is the Greek name for Mercury.

^7🤖 "Additive [aspect] by number and by light" refers to the enhancement of configuration either by aspectual measure (numerical) or by increase in lunar phases (light), i.e., waxing or waning.

^8🤖 The phrase "in whatever way the mind inclines toward the stars or the Moon" (νοῖς ἀστράσι ἢ Σελήνη προσκλιθῇ) can be interpreted as either psychological disposition or astrologically significant inclination; ambiguity remains.

^9🤖 "Trigon" refers to the trine, a 120° aspect.

^10🤖 "Cardiac crisis" translates καρδιακὴν πάντως περίστασιν, a technical medical phrase which may have broader connotations in ancient context (perhaps acute or critical illness involving the heart or chest).

^11🤖 "Numerically subtractive" refers to a separating aspect or the waning phase of the Moon, depending on context; this configuration is considered lessening or resolving in effect.
